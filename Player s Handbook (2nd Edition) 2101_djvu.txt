Special Thanks To: 

A vast work like the AD&D® 2nd Edition 
game doesn’t spring into being from nothing. Especially not in this 
case, since this is the 2nd Edition of the game. The AD&D game 
owes its existence the efforts of many people. 

The AD&D game probably never would have existed without the 
work of Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. Together they introduced 
the world to the concept of role-playing games. Their efforts 
resulted in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game, forerunner of 
the AD&D system. Gary Gygax then went on to be the principal 
creator and guiding force of the AD&D rules. His particular vision 
set the standards for what the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & 
DRAGONS® game was—and what it wasn’t. 

A game such as the AD&D game, or any role-playing game, is 
. much more than the work of just one man. Many others have writ- 
ten rule books, contributed ideas, playtested, criticized, and added 
their own personal interpretations of what the game is. For their 
efforts, they too deserve credit. New rule books were written by 
David “Zeb” Cook (Oriental Adventures), Jeff Grubb (Manual of 
the Planes), Tracy Hickman (DRAGONLANCE® Adventures), Kim 
Mohan (Wilderness Survival Guide), Douglas Niles (Dungeoneer's 
Survival Guide), Jim Ward (Legends and Lore, GREYHAWK® 
Adventures), and Margaret Weis (DRAGONLANCE® Adven- 
tures). 

Over the years, there have been many people who have written 
rules, edited manuscripts, offered suggestions, and playtested. With 
an undertaking as large as the AD&D game, this list is long, but 


each of these people deserves mention for his or her efforts. While 
there is not enough space to mention exactly what each person did, 
each has been important to the development of the game. Mark 
Acres, Peter Aronson, Jim Bambra, Brian Blume, Mike Breault, 
Mike Carr, Sean Cleary, Troy Denning, Michael Dobson, Jean- 
Louis Fiasson, Joe Fischer, Ed Greenwood, Ernie Gygax, Luke 
Gygax, Mary Gygax, Allen Hammack, Neal Healey, Kevin Hen- 
dryx, J. Eric Holmes, Tom Holsinger, Jake Jaquet, Harold Johnson, 
Timothy Jones, Tim Kask, Jeff Key, Tom Kirby, Rick Krebs, Rob 
Kuntz, Terry Kuntz, Dave LaForce, Len Lakofka, Jeff Leason, Alan 
Lucion, Francois Marcela-Froideval, Steve Marsh, Dave Megarry, 
Frank Mentzer, Tom Moldvay, Roger Moore, Mike Mornard, 
Graeme Morris, Bruce Nesmith, Schar Niebling, Will Niebling, Erol 
Otus, Jeff Perrin, Penny Petticord, Jon Pickens, Mike Price, Pat 
Price, Jean Rabe, Paul Reiche III], Gregory Rihn, Tom Robertson, 
Evan Robinson, John Sapienza, Lawrence Schick, Doug Sch- 
wegman, Carl Smith, Curtis Smith, Ed Sollers, Steve Sullivan, Den- 
nis Sustare, Dave Sutherland, Dave Trampier, Don Turnbull, Jack 
Vance, Jean Wells, Tom Wham, Mike Williams, Skip Williams, and 
Steve Winter all deserve a share of the credit. 

Even so, the list of those to thank is not complete. It can never be 
complete. The AD&D game is continually evolving—each player 
and each DM adds his own touch to the whole. No list of special 
thanks can be complete without recognizing the most important 
contributors of all—the millions of players who, over the years, 
have made the AD&D game what it is today.

Foreword to the Second Edition 


It has been a long time getting here. I don’t mean the months, perhaps even years, you may 
have waited for a revised, expanded, and improved 2nd Edition of the AD&D® game. I mean 
the long time it has taken me to reach this point, the writing of the foreword. Forewords are 
written last, so that you can summarize your feelings and experiences about the book you have 
written. 

It’s not accurate to say this is a book that I alone have written. First off, there are a lot of 
other names listed in the credits. They, especially the editors, contributed time and talents that I 
don't have. Improving the organization and readability was one of the reasons we started this 
project in the first place. These are tasks that can’t be done without talented editors who play 
and care about the game. If you discover that it’s easier to find rules during your gaming 
sessions and that everything seems to make more sense, thank the editors. 

Even with the editors, this is not our work alone. None of this would ever have come into 
being without interested and involved players. The people who really decided what needed to be 
done for the 2nd Edition are the players who mailed in questions, everyone who wrote an article 
for DRAGON® Magazine, and everyone who button-holed me (or other designers) at 
conventions. These were the people who decided what needed to be done, what needed fixing, 
what was unclear, and what they just didn’t like. I didn’t sit in a vacuum and make these 
decisions. As the designer and developer, I had to make the final choice, but those choices were 
based on your input. And your input is the most valuable asset we have going. 

So how do I feel? Excited, exhausted, relieved, and nervous—all at once. It's a great bag of 
emotions. I’m excited to see this book come out. I've spent more time on this than I have on any 
other single work I’ve done. That leads to exhaustion. The 2nd Edition has demanded and 
received hours upon months of attention. Now that it is finally coming out, the feeling of relief 
is beginning to set in. There were times when the task looked impossible, when it seemed it 
would never end, or when everything was going wrong. Only now, when it’s in the final stages 
of polishing, am I beginning to realize that it really is done. And of course there is nervousness. 
The AD&D game is the granddaddy of all role-playing games. You've made it perfectly clear 
that you liked the first edition of the AD&D game, even with all its warts. I liked (and still like) 
it. So, now with the arrival of 2nd Edition, of course I'm nervous. 

None of this comes as any surprise. I volunteered to prepare the 2nd Edition because I wanted 
to do something for the game I liked. The ten years of experience I've had in game design has 
shown me what works and what doesn’t and sometimes even why. At the very start, we 
outlined the goals: to make it easier to find things, to make the rules easier to understand, to fix 
the things that did not work, to add the best new ideas from the expansions and other sources, 
and, most important of all, to make sure the game was still the one you knew and enjoyed. Of 
them all, the last was the hardest and most demanding, conflicting as it did with my basic desire 
to design things. Fortunately, things didn’t rest on me alone. Lots of eager eyes, from those of 
fellow designers to those of enthusiastic playtesters, minutely examined this book and restrained 
me from overzealousness. It hasn't always been easy to walk the fine line between “not enough” 
and “too much.” 

In the past two years, I’ve talked to interested players many times, hearing their concerns and 
sharing my ideas. It was at the end of one of these talks (at a convention in Missoula, Montana), 
just as I described some rules change, that one of the listeners smiled and said, “You know, 
we've been doing that for years.” And that is what the 2nd Edition is all about—collecting and 
organizing all those things that we, as players, have been doing for years.

Welcome to the Second Edition AD&D” Game 


You are reading the key to the most exciting 
hobby in the world—role-playing games. 
These first few pages will introduce you 
to the second edition of the most successful 
role-playing game ever published. If you are 
a novice role-player, stop right here and 
read the section labeled The Real Basics (on 
the next page). When you understand what 
role-playing and the AD&D® game are all 
about, come back to this point and read the 
rest of the introduction. If you are an experi- 
enced role-player, skip The Real Basics. 


Why a Second Edition? 


Before answering 
that question, let's define what the second 
edition of the AD&D game is and is not. 

This second edition of the AD&D game is 
a lot different from the first edition. The 
presentation of the game has been cleaned 
up. The rules are reorganized, clarified, and 
streamlined. Where necessary, things that 
didn’t work have been fixed. Things that did 
work haven't been changed. 

The second edition of the AD&D game is 
not a statement of what any one person 
thinks the game should be. It is the result of 
more than three years of discussion, 
thought, consultation, review, and play- 
testing. 

Now to the question of “Why a second 
edition?” The AD&D game evolved over 
the course of 16 years. During that time, the 
game grew tremendously through play. 
Changes and improvements (and a few mis- 
takes) were made. These were published in 
subsequent volumes. By 1988, the game 
consisted of 12 hardcover rule books. It was 
physically and intellectually unwieldy (but 
still a lot of fun). The time was right to reor- 
ganize and recombine all that information 
into a manageable package. That package is 
the second edition. 


How the Rule Books 
are Organized 


The AD&D game 
rule books are intended primarily as refer- 
ence books. They are designed so any spe- 
cific rule can be found quickly and easily 
during a game. 

Everything a player needs to know is in 
the Player's Handbook. That's not to say 
that all the rules are in this book. But every 
rule that a player needs to know in order to 
play the game is in this book. 

A few rules have been reserved for the 
Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG). These 
either cover situations that very seldom 
arise or give the Dungeon Master (DM) 
information that players should not have 
beforehand. Everything else in the DMG is 
information that only the Dungeon Master 
needs. If the DM feels that players need to 


know something that is explained in the 
DMG, he will tell them. 

Like the DMG, the Monstrous Compen- 
dium is the province of the DM. This gives 
complete and detailed information about 
the monsters, people, and other creatures 
inhabiting the AD&D world. Some DMs 
don’t mind if players read this information, 
but the game is more fun if players don’t 
know everything about their foes—it 
heightens the sense of discovery and danger 
of the unknown. 


Learning the Game 


If you have played 
the AD&D game before, you know almost 
everything you need to play the second edi- 
tion. We advise you to read the entire Play- 
ers Handbook, but the biggest changes are 
in these chapters: Character Classes, Com- 
bat, and Experience. Be sure to read at least 
those three chapters before sitting down to 
play. 

If you come to a term you do not under- 
stand, look for it in the Glossary, which 
begins on page 11. 

If you have never played the AD&D 
game before, the best way to learn to play 
the game is to find a group of experienced 
players and join them. They can get you 
immediately into the game and explain 
things as you need to know them. You don’t 
need to read anything beforehand. In fact, 
it's best if you can play the game for several 
hours with experienced players before read- 
ing any of the rules. One of the truly mar- 
velous things about a role-playing game is 
that even though the concept is difficult to 
explain, it is simple to demonstrate. 

If none of your friends are involved in a 
game, the best place to find experienced 
players is through your local hobby store. 
Role-playing and general gaming clubs are 
common and are always eager to accept 
new members. Many hobby stores offer a 
bulletin board through which DMs can 
advertise for new players and new players 
can ask for information about new or ongo- 
ing games. If there isno hobby store in your 
area, check at the local library or school. 

If you can’t find anyone else who knows 
the AD&D game, you can teach yourself. 
Read the Player's Handbook and create 
some characters. Try to create a variety of 
character classes. Then pick up a pre- 
packaged adventure module for low-level 
characters, round up two or three friends, 
and dive into it. You probably will make lots 
of mistakes and wonder constantly whether 
you are doing everything wrong. Even if 
you are, don’t worry about it. The AD&D 
game is big, but eventually you'll bring it 
under control. 


The Second Edition 
AD&D Game Line 


Quite a few books 
and other products are published for the 
AD&D game. As a player, you need only 
one of them—this book. Every player and 
DM should have a copy of the Player's 
Handbook. Everything else is either option- 
al or intended for the Dungeon Master. 

The Dungeon Master's Guide is essential 
for the DM and it is for the DM only. Play- 
ers who are not themselves DMs have no 
cause to read the DMG. 

The Monstrous Compendium is not one, 
but several products. The book can be 
expanded whenever new compendiums are 
released. The first pack of monsters is essen- 
tial to the game. It includes the most com- 
monly encountered monsters, mythical 
beasts, and legendary creatures. Additional 
packs expand on these monsters and give 
the game more variety. Specialty 
compendiums—those for Greyhawk, the 
Forgotten Realms, Kara-Tur, etc.—are high- 
ly recommended for DMs who play in those 
settings. 

Expanded character class books—The 
Complete Fighter, The Complete Thief, 
etc.—provide a lot more detail on these 
character classes than does the Player's 
Handbook. These books are entirely 
optional. They are for those players who 
really want a world of choice for their char- 
acters. 

Adventure modules contain complete 
game adventures. These are especially use- 
ful for DMs who aren't sure how to create 
their own adventures and for DMs who 
need an adventure quickly and don’t have 
time to write one of their own. 


A Note About Pronouns 


The male pronoun 
(he, him, his) is used exclusively throughout 
the second edition of the AD&D game rules. 
We hope this won't be construed by anyone 
to be an attempt to exclude females from the 
game or imply their exclusion. Centuries of 
use have neutered the male pronoun. In 
written material it is clear, concise, and 
familiar. Nothing else is. 


Creating a Character 


To create a charac- 
ter to play in the AD&D game, proceed, in 
order, through Chapters 1 through 6. 
(Chapter 5 is optional). These chapters will 
tell you how to generate your character's 
ability scores, race, and class, decide on his 
alignment, pick proficiencies, and buy 
equipment. Once you have done all this, 
your character is ready for adventure! 


The Real Basics 


This section is intended for novice role- 
players. If you have played role-playing 
games before, don’t be surprised if what you 
read here sounds familiar. 

Games come in a wide assortment of 
types: board games, card games, word 
games, picture games, miniatures games. 
Even within these categories are subcatego- 
ries. Board games, for example, can be 
divided into path games, real estate games, 
military simulation games, abstract strategy 
games, mystery games, and a host of others. 

Still, in all this mass of games, role- 
playing games are unique. They form a cat- 
egory all their own that doesn’t overlap any 
other category. 

For that reason, role-playing games are 
hard to describe. Comparisons don’t work 
because there isn’t anything similar to com- 
pare them to. At least, not without stretch- 
ing your imagination well beyond its 
normal, everyday extension. 

But then, stretching your imagination is 
what role-playing is all about. So let’s try an 
analogy. 

Imagine that you are playing a simple 
board game, called Snakes and Ladders. 
Your goal is to get from the bottom to the 
top of the board before all the other players. 
Along the way are traps that can send you 
sliding back toward your starting position. 
There are also ladders that can let you jump 
ahead, closer to the finish space. So far, it’s 
pretty simple and pretty standard. 

Now let's change a few things. Instead of 
a flat, featureless board with a path winding 
rom side to side, let's have a maze. You are 
standing at the entrance, and you know that 
there's an exit somewhere, but you don't 
<now where. You have to find it. 

Instead of snakes and ladders, we'll put in 
nidden doors and secret passages. Don't roll 
a die to see how far you move; you can 
nove as far as you want. Move down the 
orridor to the intersection. You can turn 
‘ight, or left, or go straight ahead, or go 
yack the way you came. Or, as long as 
you're here, you can look for a hidden door. 
f you find one, it will open into another 
itretch of corridor. That corridor might take 
you straight to the exit or lead you into a 
lind alley. The only way to find out is to 
tep in and start walking. 

Of course, given enough time, eventually 
you'll find the exit. To keep the game inter- 
sting, let's put some other things in the 
naze with you. Nasty things. Things like 
yampire bats and hobgoblins and zombies 
ind ogres. Of course, we'll give you a sword 
ind a shield, so if you meet one of these 
hings you can defend yourself. You do 
now how to use a sword, don’t you? 

And there are other players in the maze as 
vell. They have swords and shields, too. 
tow do you suppose another player would 
eact if you chance to meet? He might 
ttack, but he also might offer to team up. 


After all, even an ogre might think twice 
about attacking two people carrying sharp 
swords and stout shields. 

Finally, let's put the board somewhere 
you can't see it. Let's give it to one of the 
players and make that player the referee. 
Instead of looking at the board, you listen to 
the referee as he describes what you can see 
from your position on the board. You tell 
the referee what you want to do and he 
moves your piece accordingly. As the ref- 
eree describes your surroundings, try to pic- 
ture them mentally. Close your eyes and 
construct the walls of the maze around 
yourself. Imagine the hobgoblin as the ref- 
eree describes it whooping and gamboling 
down the corridor toward you. Now imag- 
ine how you would react in that situation 
and tell the referee what you are going to do 
about it. 

We have just constructed a simple role- 
playing game. It is not a sophisticated game, 
but it has the essential element that makes a 
role-playing game: The player is placed in 
the midst of an unknown or dangerous situ- 
ation created by a referee and must work his 
way through it. 

This is the heart of role-playing. The 
player adopts the role of a character and 
then guides that character through an 
adventure. The player makes decisions, 
interacts with other characters and players, 
and, essentially, “pretends” to be his charac- 
ter during the course of the game. That 
doesn’t mean that the player must jump up 
and down, dash around, and act like his 
character. It means that whenever the char- 
acter is called on to do something or make a 
decision, the player pretends that he is in 
that situation and chooses an appropriate 
course of action. 

Physically, the players and referee (the 
DM) should be seated comfortably around a 
table with the referee at the head. Players 
need plenty of room for papers, pencils, 
dice, rule books, drinks, and snacks. The 
referee needs extra space for his maps, dice, 
rule books, and assorted notes. 


The Goal 


Another major dif- 
ference between role-playing games and 
other games is the ultimate goal. Everyone 
assumes that a game must have a beginning 
and an end and that the end comes when 
someone wins. That doesn’t apply to role- 
playing because no one “wins” in a role- 
playing game. The point of playing is not to 
win but to have fun and to socialize. 

An adventure usually has a goal of some 
sort: protect the villagers from the mon- 
sters; rescue the lost princess; explore the 
ancient ruins. Typically, this goal can be 
attained in a reasonable playing time: four 
to eight hours is standard. This might 
require the players to get together for one, 


9 


two, or even three playing sessions to reach 
their goal and complete the adventure. 

But the game doesn’t end when an adven- 
ture is finished. The same characters can go 
on to new adventures. Such a series of 
adventures is called a campaign. 

Remember, the point of an adventure is 
not to win but to have fun while working 
toward a common goal. But the length of 
any particular adventure need not impose 
an artificial limit on the length of the game. 
The AD&D® game embraces more than 
enough adventure to keep a group of char- 
acters occupied for years. 


Required Materials 


Aside from a copy 
of this book, very little is needed to play the 
AD&D game. 

You will need some sort of character 
record. TSR publishes character record 
sheets that are quite handy and easy to use, 
but any sheet of paper will do. Blank paper, 
lined paper, or even graph paper can be 
used. A double-sized sheet of paper (11 x 17 
inches), folded in half, is excellent. Keep 
your character record in pencil, because it 
will change frequently during the game. A 
good eraser is also a must. 

A full set of polyhedral dice is necessary. 
A full set consists of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and 
20-sided dice. A few extra 6- and 10-sided 
dice are a good idea. Polyhedral dice should 
be available wherever you got this book. 

Throughout these rules, the various dice 
are referred to by a code that is in the form: 
# of dice, followed by “d/’ followed by a 
numeral for the type of dice. In other 
words, if you are to roll one 6-sided die, you 
would see “roll 1d6.’ Five 12-sided dice are 
referred to as “5d12.” (If you don’t have five 
12-sided dice, just roll one five times and 
add the results.) 

When the rules say to roll “percentile 
dice” or “1d100/’ you need to generate a 
random number from 1 to 100. One way to 
do this is to roll two 10-sided dice of differ- 
ent colors. Before you roll, designate one 
die as the tens place and the other as the 
ones place. Rolling them together enables 
you to generate a number from 1 to 100 (a 
result of “O” on both dice is read as “00” or 
“100"). For example, if the blue die (repre- 
senting the tens place) rolls an “8” and the 
red die (ones place) rolls a “5/’ the result is 
85. Another, more expensive, way to gener- 
ate a number from 1 to 100 is to buy one of 
the dice that actually have numbers from 1 
to 100 on them. 

At least one player should have a few 
sheets of graph paper for mapping the 
group’s progress. Assorted pieces of scratch 
paper are handy for making quick notes, for 
passing secret messages to other players or 
the DM, or for keeping track of odd bits of 
information that you don’t want cluttering 


The Real Basics 


up your character record. 

Miniature figures are handy for keeping 
track of where everyone is in a confusing sit- 
uation like a battle. These can be as elabo- 
rate or simple as you like. Some players use 
miniature lead or pewter figures painted to 
resemble their characters. Plastic soldiers, 
chess pieces, boardgame pawns, dice, or 
bits of paper can work just as well. 


An Example of Play 


To further clarify 
what really goes on during an AD&D® 
game, read the following example. This is 
typical of the sort of action that occurs dur- 
ing a playing session. 

Shortly before this example begins, three 
player characters fought a skirmish with a 
wererat (a creature similar to a werewolf 
but which becomes an enormous rat instead 
of a wolf). The wererat was wounded and 
fled down a tunnel. The characters are in 
pursuit. The group includes two fighters 
and a cleric. Fighter 1 is the group's leader. 


DM: You've been following this tunnel for 
about 120 yards. The water on the floor 
is ankle deep and very cold. Now and 
then you feel something brush against 
your foot. The smell of decay is getting 
stronger. The tunnel is gradually filling 
with a cold mist. 

Fighter 1: I don’t like this at all. Can we see 
anything up ahead that looks like a door- 
way, or a branch in the tunnel? 

DM: Within the range of your torchlight, 
the tunnel is more or less straight. You 
don’t see any branches or doorways. 

Cleric: The wererat we hit had to come this 
way. There's nowhere else to go. 

Fighter 1: Unless we missed a hidden door 
along the way. I hate this place; it gives 
me the creeps. 

Fighter 2: We have to track down that were- 
rat. I say we keep going. 

Fighter 1: OK. We keep moving down the 
tunnel. But keep your eyes open for any- 
thing that might be a door. 

DM: Another 30 or 35 yards down the tun- 
nel, you find a stone block on the floor. 

Fighter 1: A block? I take a closer look. 

DM: It's a cut block, about 12 by 16 inches, 
and 18 inches or so high. It looks like a 
different kind of rock than the rest of the 
tunnel. 

Fighter 2: Where is it? Is it in the center of 
the tunnel or off to the side? 

DM: It's right up against the side. 

Fighter 1: Can I move it? 

DM (checking the character's Strength 
score): Yeah, you can push it around 
without too much trouble. 

Fighter 1: Hmmm. This is obviously a 
marker of some sort. I want to check this 
area for secret doors. Spread out and 
examine the walls. 


DM (rolls several dice behind his rule book, 
where players can’t see the results): 
Nobody finds anything unusual along 
the walls. 

Fighter 1: It has to be here somewhere. 
What about the ceiling? 

DM: You can’t reach the ceiling. It’s about a 
foot beyond your reach. 

Cleric: Of course! That block isn’t a marker, 
it's a step. I climb up on the block and 
start prodding the ceiling. 

DM (rolling a few more dice): You poke 
around for 20 seconds or so, then sud- 
denly part of the tunnel roof shifts. 
You've found a panel that lifts away. 

Fighter 1: Open it very carefully. 

Cleric: I pop it up a few inches and push it 
aside slowly. Can | see anything? 

DM: Your head is still below the level of the 
opening, but you see some dim light 
from one side. 

Fighter 1: We boost him up so he can get a 
better look. 

DM: OK, your friends boost you up into the 
room... 

Fighter 1: No, no! We boost him just high 
enough to get his head through the open- 


ing. 

DM: OK, you boost him up a foot. The two 
of you are each holding one of his legs. 
Cleric, you see another tunnel, pretty 
much like the one you were in, but it 
only goes off in one direction. There's a 
doorway about 10 yards away with a 
soft light inside. A line of muddy 
pawprints leads from the hole you're in 
to the doorway. 

Cleric: Fine. I want the fighters to go first. 

DM: As they're lowering you back to the 
block, everyone hears some grunts, 
splashing, and clanking weapons coming 
from further down the lower tunnel. 
They seem to be closing fast. 

Cleric: Up! Up! Push me back up through 
the hole! I grab the ledge and haul myself 
up. I'll help pull the next guy up. 

(All three characters scramble up through 
the hole.) 

DM: What about the panel? 

Fighter 1: We push it back into place. 

DM: It slides back into its slot with a nice, 
loud “clunk.” The grunting from below 
gets a lot louder. 

Fighter 1: Great, they heard it. Cleric, get 
over here and stand on this panel. We're 
going to check out that doorway. 

DM: Cleric, you hear some shouting and 
shuffling around below you, then there's 
a thump and the panel you're standing 
on lurches. 

Cleric: They're trying to batter it open! 

DM (to the fighters): When you peer around 
the doorway, you see a small, dirty room 
with a small cot, a table, and a couple of 
stools. On the cot is a wererat curled up 
into a ball. Its back is toward you. 
There's another door in the far wall anda 


10 


small gong in the corner. 

Fighter 1: Is the wererat moving? 

DM: Not a bit. Cleric, the panel just 
thumped again. You can see a little crack 
in it now. 

Cleric: Do something quick, you guys. 
When this panel starts coming apart, I'm 
getting off it. 

Fighter 1: OK already! | step into the room 
and prod the wererat with my shield. 
What happens? 

DM: Nothing. You see blood on the cot. 

Fighter 1: Is this the same wererat we fought 
before? 

DM: Who knows? All wererats look the 
same to you. Cleric, the panel thumps 
again. That crack is looking really big. 

Cleric: That's it. I get off the panel. I'm mov- 
ing into the room with everybody else. 

DM: There's a tremendous smash and you 
hear chunks of rock banging around out 
in the corridor, followed by lots of snarl- 
ing and squeaking. You see flashes of 
torchlight and wererat shadows through 
the doorway. 

Fighter 1: All right, the other fighter and I 
move up to block the doorway. That's 
the narrowest area, they can only come 
through it one or two at a time. Cleric, 
you stay in the room and be ready with 
your spells. 

Fighter 2: At last, a decent, stand-up fight! 

DM: As the first wererat appears in the 
doorway with a spear in his paws, you 
hear a slam behind you. 

Cleric: I spin around. What is it? 

DM: The door in the back of the room is 
broken off its hinges. Standing in the 
doorway, holding a mace in each paw, is 
the biggest, ugliest wererat you've ever 
seen. A couple more pairs of red eyes are 
shining through the darkness behind 
him. He’s licking his chops in a way that 
you find very unsettling. 

Cleric: Aaaaarrrgh! I scream the name of 
my deity at the top of my lungs and then 
flip over the cot with the dead wererat on 
it so the body lands in front of him. I've 
got to have some help here, guys. 

Fighter 1 (to fighter 2): Help him, I'll handle 
this end of the room. (To DM): I'm 
attacking the wererat in the doorway. 

DM: While fighter 2 is switching positions, 
the big wererat looks at the body on the 
floor and his jaw drops. He looks back 
up and says, “That's Ignatz. He was my 
brother. You killed my brother.” Then he 
raises both maces and leaps at you. 


At this point a ferocious melee breaks 
out. The DM uses the combat rules to play 
out the battle. If the characters survive, they 
can continue on whatever course they 
choose. 


Ability - any of the six natural traits that rep- 
resent the basic definition of a player char- 
acter: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, 
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. A 
player character's abilities are determined at 
the beginning of a game by rolling 6-sided 
dice (d6s). The scores continue to be used 
throughout the game as a means of deter- 
mining success or failure of many actions. 
Ability check - a 1d20 roll against one of 
your character's ability scores (modifiers 
may be added to or subtracted from the die 
roll). A result that is equal to or less than 
your character's ability score indicates that 
the attempted action succeeds. 

AC - abbreviation for Armor Class (q.v.). 
Alignment - a factor in defining a player 
character that reflects his basic attitude to- 
ward society and the forces of the universe. 
Basically there are nine categories demon- 
strating the character's relationship to order 
vs. chaos and good vs. evil. A player char- 
acter’s alignment is selected by the player 
when the character is created. 

Area of effect - the area in which a magical 
spell or a breath weapon works on any crea- 
tures unless they make a saving throw. 
Armor Class (abbr. AC) - a rating for the 
protective value of a type of armor, figured 
from 10 (no armor at all) to 0 or even —10 
(the best magical armor). The higher the 
AC, the more vulnerable the character is to 
attack. 

Attack roll - The 1d20 roll used to determine 
if an attack is successful. 

Bend bars/lift gates roll - the roll of percen- 
tile dice to determine whether a character 
succeeds in bending metal bars, lifting a 
heavy portcullis, or similar task. The result 
needed is a function of Strength and can be 
found in Table 1. 

Bonus spells - extra spells at various spell 
levels that a priest is entitled to because of 
high Wisdom; shown in Table 5. 

Breath weapon - the ability of a dragon or 
other creature to spew a substance out of its 
mouth just by breathing, without making 
an attack roll. Those in the area of effect 
must roll a saving throw. 

Cha - abbreviation for Charisma (q.v.). 
Chance of spell failure - the percentage 
chance that a priest spell will fail when cast. 
Based on Wisdom, it is shown in Table 5. 
Chance to know spell - the percentage 
chance for a wizard to learn a new spell. 
Based on Intelligence, it is shown in Table 4. 
Charisma (abbr. Cha) - an ability score rep- 
resenting a character's persuasiveness, per- 
sonal magnetism, and ability to lead. 
Common - the language that all player char- 
acters in the AD&D® game world speak. 
Other languages may require the use of pro- 
ficiency slots. 

Con - abbreviation for Constitution (q.v.). 
Constitution (abbr. Con) - an ability score 
that represents a character's general phy- 
sique, hardiness, and state of health. 


d - abbreviation for dice or die. A roll that 
calls for-2d6, for example, means that the 
player rolls two six-sided dice. 

d3 - since there is no such thing as a three- 
sided die, a roll calling for d3 means to use a 
d6é, making 1 and 2 be a 1, 3 and 4 be a 2, 
and 5 and 6 be a3. 

d4 - a four-sided die. 

dé - a six-sided die. 

d8 - an eight-sided die. 

d10 - a ten-sided die. Two d10s can be used 
as percentile dice (q.v.). 

d12 - a twelve-sided die. 

d20 - a twenty-sided die. 

d100 - either an actual 100-sided die or two 
different-colored ten-sided dice to be rolled 
as percentile dice (q.v.). 

DMG -a reference to the Dungeon Master's 
Guide. 

Damage - the effect of a successful attack or 
other harmful situation, measured in hit 
points.

human: a dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, or 
halfling. 

Dex - abbreviation for Dexterity (q.v.). 
Dexterity (abbr. Dex) - an ability score rep- 
resenting a combination of a character's

switches character class after having al- 
ready progressed several levels. Only hu- 
mans can be dual-classed. 

Encumbrance - the amount, in pounds, that 
a character is carrying. How much he can 
carry and how being encumbered affects his 
movement rate are based on Strength and 
are shown in Tables 47 and 48. Encum- 
brance is an optional rule. 

Energy drain - the ability of a creature, espe- 
cially undead, to drain energy in the form of 
class levels from a character, in addition to 
the normal loss of hit points. 

Experience points (abbr. XP) - points a char- 
acter earns (determined by the Dungeon 
Master) for completing an adventure, for 
doing something related to his class particu- 
larly well, or for solving a major problem. 
Experience points are accumulated, ena- 
bling the character to rise in level in his 
class, as shown in Table 14 for warriors, Ta- 
ble 20 for wizards, Table 23 for priests, and 
Table 25 for rogues. 

Follower - a non-player character who 
works for a character for money but is ini- 
tially drawn to his reputation. 

Gaze attack - the ability of a creature, such 
as a basilisk, to attack simply by making eye 
contact with the victim. 

Henchmen - non-player characters who 
work for a character mainly out of loyalty

henchmen a character can have is based on 
Charisma and is shown in Table 6. The DM 
and the player share control of the hench- 
men. 


Hireling - non-player characters who work 
for a character just for money. Hirelings are 
completely under the control of the DM. 
Hit dice - the dice rolled to determine a char- 
acter’s hit points. Up to a certain level, one 
or more new Hit Dice are rolled each time a 
character attains a new class level. A fighter, 
for example, has only one 10-sided Hit Die 
(1d10) at Ist level, but when he rises to the 
2nd level, the player rolls a second d10, in- 
creasing the character's hit points. 

Hit points - a number representing 1. how 
much damage a character can suffer before 
being killed, determined by Hit Dice (q.v.). 
The hit points lost to injury can usually be 
regained by rest or healing. 2. how much 
damage a specific attack does, determined 
by weapon or monster statistics, and sub- 
tracted from a player's total. 

Infravision - the ability of certain character 
races or monsters to see in the dark. Infra- 
vision generally works up to 60 feet in the 
darkness.

bat round, usually determined by the lowest 
roll of a 10-sided die. The initiative roll is 
eliminated if surprise (q.v.) is achieved. 

Int - abbreviation for Intelligence (q.v.). 
Intelligence (abbr, Int) - an ability score rep- 
resenting a character's memory, reasoning, 
and learning ability. 

Italic type - used primarily to indicate spells 
and magical items. 

Level - any of several different game factors 
that are variable in degree, especially: 1. 
class level, a measure of the character's 
power, starting at the Ist level as a begin- 
ning adventurer and rising through the ac- 
cumulation of experience points to the 20th 
level or higher. At each level attained, the 
character receives new powers. 2. spell 
level, a measure of the power of a magical 
spell. A magic-using character can use only 
those spells for which his class level qualifies 
him. Wizard spells come in nine levels (Ta- 
ble 21); priest spells in seven (Table 24). 
Loyalty base - a bonus added to or a penalty 
subtracted from the probability that hench- 
men are going to stay around when the go- 
ing gets tough. Based on the character's 
Charisma, it is shown in Table 6. 

M - abbreviation for material component 
(q.v.). 

Magical defense adjustment - a bonus 
added to or a penalty subtracted from sav- 
ing throws vs. spells that attack the mind. 
Based on Wisdom, it is shown in Table 5.

statistical abilities in combat. 

Material component (abbr. M) - any specific 
item that must be handled in some way dur- 
ing the casting of a magic spell.

fighting in direct contact, such as with 
swords, claws, or fists, as opposed to fight- 
ing with missile weapons or spells. 

Missile combat - combat involving the use 
of weapons that shoot missiles or items that 
can be thrown. Because the combat is not 
“toe-to-toe,” the rules are slightly different 
than those for regular combat. 

Movement rate - a number used in calculat- 
ing how far and how fast a character can 
move in a round. This number is in units of 
10 yards per round outdoors, but it repre- 
sents 10 feet indoors. Thus, an MR of 6 is 60 
yards per round in the wilderness, but only 
60 feet per round in a dungeon. 

MR - abbreviation for movement rate 
(q.v.). 

Multi-class character - a demihuman who 
improves in two or more classes at the same

is directly opposed to a specialist's school of 
choice, thus preventing him from learning 
spells from that school, as shown in Table 
22 


PC - abbreviation for player character 
(q.v.). 

Percentage (or percent) chance - a number 
between 1 and 100 used to represent the 
probability of something happening. If a 
character is given an X percentage chance of 
an event occurring, the player rolls percen- 
tile dice (q.v.). 

Percentile dice - either a 100-sided die or 
two 10-sided dice used in rolling a percent- 
age number. If 2d10 are used, they are of dif- 
ferent colors, and one represents the tens 
digit while the other is the ones. 

Player character (abbr. PC) - the characters 
in a role-playing game who are under the 
control of the players. 

Poison save - a bonus or a penalty to a sav- 
ing throw vs. poison. Based on Constitu- 
tion, it is shown in Table 3. 


Prime requisite - the ability score that is 
most important to a character class; for ex- 
ample, Strength to a fighter. 

Proficiency - a character's learned skill not 
defined by his class but which gives him a 
greater percentage chance to accomplish a

as shown in Table 34. The use of proficien- 
cies in the game is optional. 

Proficiency check - the roll of a 20-sided die 
to see if a character succeeds in doing a task 
by comparing the die roll to the character's 
relevant ability score plus or minus any

die roll must be equal to or less than the abil- 
ity score for the action to succeed). 

q.v. - “which see,” or “turn to.” 

Race - a player character's species: human, 
elf, dwarf, gnome, half- elf, or halfling. 
Race puts some limitations on the PC's 
class. 

Rate of fire (abbr. ROF) - number of times a 
missile-firing or thrown weapon can be shot 
in a round. 

Reaction adjustment - a bonus added to or 
penalty subtracted from a die roll used in 
determining the success of a character's 
action. Such an adjustment is used espe- 
cially in reference to surprise (shown on Ta- 
ble 2 as a function of Dexterity) and the 
reaction of other intelligence beings to a 
character (shown on Table 6 as a function of 
Charisma). 

Regeneration - a special ability to heal faster 
than usual, based on an extraordinarily high 
Constitution, as shown in Table 3. 
Resistance - the innate ability of a being to 
withstand attack, such as by magic. 
Gnomes, for example, have a magic resist-

ally determined by the roll of 1d20. 

School of magic - One of nine different cate- 
gories of magic, based on the type of magi- 
cal energy utilized. Wizards who 
concentrate their work on a single school

To venture into the worlds of the AD&D® 
game, you first need to create a character. 
The character you create is your alter ego in 
the fantasy realms of this game, a make- 
believe person who is under your control 
and through whom you vicariously explore 
the world the Dungeon Master (DM) has 
created. 

Each character in the AD&D game has six 
abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, 
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The 
first three abilities represent the physical na- 
ture of the character, while the second three 
quantify his mental and personality traits. 


In various places throughout these rules, 
the following abbreviations are used for 
the ability names: Strength—Str; 
Dexterity—Dex; Constitution—Con; In- 
telligence—Int; Wisdom—Wis; Charisma 
—Cha, 


Rolling Ability Scores 


Let's first see how 
to generate ability scores for your character, 
after which definitions of each ability will 
be given. 

The six ability scores are determined ran- 
domly by rolling six-sided dice to obtain a 
score from 3 to 18. There are several meth- 
ods for rolling up these scores. 
® Method I: Roll three six-sided dice (3d6); 
the total shown on the dice is your charac- 
ter’s Strength ability score. Repeat this for 
Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis- 
dom, and Charisma, in that order. This 
method gives a range of scores from 3 to 18, 
with most results in the 9 to 12 range. Only 
a few characters have high scores (15 and 
above), so you should treasure these charac- 
ters. 


Alternative Dice-Rolling Methods 


Method I creates 
characters whose ability scores are usually 
between 9 and 12. If you would rather play 
a character of truly heroic proportions, ask 
your DM if he allows players to use optional 
methods for rolling up characters. These op- 
tional methods are designed to produce 
above-average characters. 
® Method II: Roll 3d6 twice, noting the to- 
tal of each roll. Use whichever result you 
prefer for your character's Strength score. 
Repeat this for Dexterity, Constitution, In- 
telligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. This al- 
lows you to pick the best score from each 
pair, generally ensuring that your character 
does not have any really low ability scores 
(but low ability scores are not all that bad 
anyway!). 


Chapter 1: 


© Method III: Roll 3d6 six times and jot 
down the total for each roll, Assign the 
scores to your character's six abilities how- 
ever you want. This gives you the chance to 
custom-tailor your character, although you 
are not guaranteed high scores. 

© Method IV: Roll 3d6 twelve times and jot 
down all twelve totals. Choose six of these 
rolls (generally the six best rolls) and assign 
them to your character's abilities however 
you want. This combines the best of meth- 
ods II and III, but takes somewhat longer. 

As an example, Joan rolls 3d6 twelve 
times and gets results of 12, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 9, 
12, 6, 11, 10, and 7. She chooses the six best 
rolls (15, 12, 12, 11, 10, and 10) and then as- 
signs them to her character's abilities so as to 
create the strengths and weaknesses that she 
wants her character to have (see the ability 
descriptions following this section for expla- 
nations of the abilities). 
© Method V: Roll four six-sided dice (4d6). 
Discard the lowest die and total the remain- 
ing three. Repeat this five more times, then 
assign the six numbers to the character's 
abilities however you want. This is a fast 
method that gives you a good character, but 
you can still get low scores (after all, you 
could roll 1s on all four dice!). 
® Method VI: This method can be used if 
you want to create a specific type of charac- 
ter. It does not guarantee that you will get 
the character you want, but it will improve 
your chances. 

Each ability starts with a score of 8. Then 
roll seven dice. These dice can be added to 
your character's abilities as you wish. All 
the points on a die must be added to the 
same ability score. For example, if a 6 is 
rolled on one die, all 6 points must be as- 
signed to one ability. You can add as many 
dice as you want to any ability, but no abil- 
ity score can exceed 18 points. If you cannot 
make an 18 by exact count on the dice, you 
cannot have an 18 score. 


The Ability Scores 


The six character 
abilities are described below. Each descrip- 
tion gives an idea of what that ability en- 
compasses. Specific game effects are also 
given. At the end of each ability description 
is the table giving all modifiers and game in- 
formation for each ability score. The un- 
shaded area of these tables contains scores a 
player character can have naturally, with- 
out the aid of magical devices, spells, or di- 
vine intervention. The blue-shaded ability 
scores can be obtained only by extraordi- 
nary means, whether by good fortune (find- 
ing a magical book that raises a score) or ill 
fortune (an attack by a creature that lowers 
a score).

Player Character Ability Scores 


Strength 


Strength (Str) mea- 
sures a character's muscle, endurance, and 
stamina. This ability is the prime requisite 
of warriors because they must be physically 
powerful in order to wear armor and wield 
heavy weapons. A fighter with a score of 16 
or more in Strength gains a 10 percent bonus 
to the experience points he earns. 

Furthermore, any warrior with a Strength 
score of 18 is entitled to roll percentile dice 
(see Glossary) to determine exceptional 
Strength; exceptional Strength improves the 
character's chance to hit an enemy, increases 
the damage-he causes with each hit, in- 
creases the weight the character is able to 
carry without a penalty for encumbrance 
(see below), and increases the character's 
ability to force open doors and similar por- 
tals. 

The rest of this section on Strength con- 
sists of explanations of the columns in Table 
1. Refer to the table as you read. 

Hit Probability adjustments are added to 
or subtracted from the attack roll rolled on 
1d20 (one 20-sided die) during combat. A 
bonus (positive number) makes the oppo- 
nent easier to hit; a penalty (negative num- 
ber) makes him harder to hit. 

Damage Adjustment also applies to com- 
bat. The listed number is added to or sub- 
tracted from the dice rolled to determine the 
damage caused by an attack (regardless of 
subtractions, a successful attack roll can 
never cause less than 1 point of damage). 
For example, a short sword normally causes 
1d6 points of damage (a range of 1 to 6). An 
attacker with Strength 17 causes one extra 
point of damage, for a range of 2 to 7 points 
of damage. The damage adjustment also ap- 
plies to missile weapons, although bows 
must be specially made to gain the bonus; 
crossbows never benefit from the user's 
Strength. 

Weight Allowance is the weight (in 
pounds) a character can carry without being 
encumbered (encumbrance measures how a 
character's possessions hamper his 
movement—see Glossary). These weights 
are expressed in pounds. A character carry- 
ing up to the listed weight can move his full 
movement rate. 

Maximum Press is the heaviest weight a 
character can pick up and lift over his head, 
A character cannot walk more than a few 
steps this way. No human or humanoid 
creature without exceptional Strength can 
lift more than twice his body weight over his 
head. In 1987, the world record for lifting a 
weight overhead in a single move was 465 
pounds. A heroic fighter with Strength 
18/00 (see Table 1) can lift up to 480 pounds 
the same way and he can hold it overhead 
for a longer time! 


Open Doors indicates the character's 
chance to force open a heavy or stuck door.

Dexterity 


Dexterity (Dex) en- 
compasses several physical attributes 
including hand-eye coordination, agility, 
reaction speed, reflexes, and balance. Dex- 
terity affects a character's reaction to a 
threat or surprise, his accuracy with thrown 
weapons and bows, and his ability to dodge 
an enemy’s blows. It is the prime requisite of 
rogues and affects their professional skills. 
A rogue with a Dexterity score of 16 or high- 
er gains a 10 percent bonus to the experience 
points he earns. 

Reaction Adjustment modifies the die roll 
to see if a character is surprised when he 
unexpectedly encounters NPCs. The more 
positive the modifier, the less likely the 
character is to be surprised. 

Missile Attack Adjustment is used to 
modify a character's die roll whenever he 
uses a missile weapon (a bow or a thrown 
weapon). A positive number makes it easier 
for the character to hit with a missile, while 
a negative number makes it harder. 

Defensive Adjustment applies to a char- 
acter’s saving throws (see Glossary) against 
attacks that can be dodged—lightning bolts, 
boulders, etc. It also modifies the character's 
Armor Class (see Glossary), representing 
his ability to dodge normal missiles and par- 
ry weapon thrusts. For example, Rath is 
wearing chain mail, giving him an Armor 
Class of 5. If his Dexterity score is 16, his 
Armor Class is modified by —2 to 3, mak- 
ing him harder to hit. If his Dexterity score 
is 5, his Armor Class is modified by +2 to 7, 
making him easier to hit. (In some situa- 


Armor Class do not apply. Usually this 
occurs when a character is attacked from 
behind or when his movement is 
restricted—attacked while prone, tied up, 
on a ledge, climbing a rope, etc.)

A character's Con- 
stitution (Con) score encompasses his phy- 
sique, fitness, health, and physical 
resistance to hardship, injury, and disease. 
Since this ability affects the character's hit 
points and chances of surviving such tre- 
mendous shocks as being physically 
reshaped by magic or resurrected from 
death, it is vitally important to all classes. 
Some classes have minimum allowable 
Constitution scores. 

A character's initial Constitution score is 
the absolute limit to the number of times the 
character can be raised or resurrected from 
death. Each such revival reduces the charac- 
ter’s Constitution score by one. Magic can 
restore a reduced Constitution score to its 
original value or even higher, but this has no 
effect on the number of times a character 
can be revived from death! Once the charac- 
ter has exhausted his original Constitution, 
nothing short of divine intervention can 
bring him back, and divine intervention is 
reserved for only the bravest and most 
faithful heroes! 

For example, Rath’s Constitution score at 
the start of his adventuring career is 12. He 
can be revived from death 12 times. If he 
dies a 13th time, he cannot be resurrected or 
raised. 

Hit Point Adjustment is added to or sub- 
tracted from each Hit Die rolled for the 
character. However, no Hit Die ever yields 
less than 1 hit point, regardless of modifica- 
tions. If an adjustment would lower the 
number rolled to 0 or less, consider the final 


result to be 1. Always use the character's 
current Constitution to determine hit point 
bonuses and penalties. 

Only warriors are entitled to a Constitu- 
tion bonus of +3 or +4. Non-warrior char- 
acters who have Constitution scores of 17 or 
18 receive only +2 per die. 

The Constitution bonus ends when a 
character reaches 10th level (9th for war- 
riors and priests) —neither the Constitution 
bonus nor Hit Dice are added to a charac- 
ter’s hit points after he has passed this level 
(see the character class descriptions that 
start on page 25). 

If a character's Constitution changes dur- 
ing the course of adventuring, his hit points 
may be adjusted up or down to reflect the 
change. The difference between the charac- 
ter’s current hit point bonus (if any) and the 
new bonus is multiplied by the character's 
level (up to 10) and added to or subtracted 
from the character's total. If Delsenora’s 
Constitution increased from 16 to 17, she 
would gain 1 hit point for every level she 
had, up to 10th level. 

System Shock states the percentage 
chance a character has to survive magical 
effects that reshape or age his body: petrifi- 
cation (and reversing petrification), poly- 
morph, magical aging, etc. It can also be 
used to see if the character retains con- 
sciousness in particularly difficult situa- 
tions. For example, an evil mage 
polymorphs his dim-witted hireling into a 
crow. The hireling, whose Constitution 
score is 13, has an 85 percent chance to sur- 
vive the change. Assuming he survives, he 
must successfully roll for system shock 
again when he is changed back to his origi- 
nal form or else he will die. 

Resurrection Survival lists a character's 
percentage chance to be successfully resur- 
rected or raised from death by magic. The 
player must roll the listed number or less on 
percentile dice for the character to be 
revived. If the dice roll fails, the character is 
dead, regardless of how many times he has 
previously been revived. Only divine inter- 
vention can bring such a character back 


again. 

Poison Save modifies the saving throw 
vs. poison for humans, elves, gnomes, and 
half-elves. Dwarves and halflings do not use 
this adjustment, since they have special 
resistances to poison attacks. The DM has 
specific information on saving throws. 

Regeneration enables those with special- 
y endowed Constitutions (perhaps by a 
wish or magical item) to heal at an advanced 
rate, regenerating damage taken. The char- 
acter heals 1 point of damage after the pas- 
age of the listed number of turns. However, 
ire and acid damage (which are more exten- 
jive than normal wounds) cannot be regen- 
rated in this manner. These injuries must 
veal normally or be dealt with by magical 
neans.

Intelligence 


Intelligence (Int) 
represents a character's memory, reasoning, 
and learning ability, including areas outside 
those measured by the written word. Intelli- 
gence dictates the number of languages a 
character can learn. Intelligence is the prime 
requisite of wizards, who must have keen 
minds to understand and memorize magical 
spells. A wizard with an Intelligence score 
of 16 or higher gains a 10 percent bonus to 
experience points earned. The wizard’s 
Intelligence dictates which spells he can 
learn and the number of spells he can memo- 
rize at one time. Only those of the highest 
Intelligence can comprehend the mighty 
magic of 9th-level spells. 

This ability gives only a general indica- 
tion of a character's mental acuity. A semi- 
intelligent character (Int 3 or 4) can speak 
(with difficulty) and is apt to react instinc- 
tively and impulsively. He is not hopeless as 
a player character (PC), but playing such a 
character correctly is not easy. A character 
with low Intelligence (Int 5-7) could also be 
called dull-witted or slow. A very intelligent 
person (Int 11 or 12) picks up new ideas 
quickly and learns easily. A highly intelli- 
gent character (Int 13 or 14) is one who can 
solve most problems without even trying 


15 


very hard. One with exceptional intelli- 
gence (Int 15 or 16) is noticeably above the 
norm. A genius character is brilliant (Int 17 
or 18). A character beyond genius is poten- 
tially more clever and more brilliant than 
can possibly be imagined. 

However, the true capabilities of a mind 
lie not in numbers—I.Q., Intelligence score, 
or whatever. Many intelligent, even bril- 
liant, people in the real world fail to apply 
their minds creatively and usefully, thus 
falling far below their own potential. Don't 
rely too heavily on your character's Intelli- 
gence score; you must provide your charac- 
ter with the creativity and energy he 
supposedly possesses! 

Number of Languages lists the number of 
additional languages the character can 
speak beyond his native language. Every 
character can speak his native language, no 
matter what his Intelligence is. This knowl- 
edge extends only to speaking the language; 
it does not include reading or writing. The 
DM must decide if your character begins the 
game already knowing these additional lan- 
guages or if the number shows only how 
many languages your character can possi- 
bly learn. The first choice will make com- 
munication easier, while the second 
increases your opportunities for role- 
playing (finding a tutor or creating a reason

Furthermore, your DM can limit your lan- 
guage selection based on his campaign. It is 
perfectly fair to rule that your fighter from 
the Frozen Wastes hasn't the tongues of the 
Southlands, simply because he has never 
met anyone who has been to the South- 
lands, 


If the DM allows characters to have pro- 
ficiencies, this column also indicates the 
number of extra proficiency slots the 
character gains due to his Intelligence. 
These extra proficiency slots can be used 
however the player desires. The charac- 
ter never needs to spend any proficiency 
slots to speak his native language. 


Spell Level lists the highest level of spells 
that can be cast by a wizard with this Intelli- 
gence, 

Chance to Learn Spell is the percentage 
probability that a wizard can learn a particu- 
lar spell. A check is made as the wizard comes 
across new spells, not as he advances in level. 
To make the check, the wizard character must 
have access to a spell book containing the 
spell. If the player rolls the listed percentage or 
less, his character can learn the spell and copy 
it into his own spell book. If the wizard fails 
the roll, he cannot check that spell again until 
he advances to the next level (provided he still 
has access to the spell). 


Maximum Number of 

Spells per Level 

Optional Rule 

’ This number indi- 


cates the maximum number of spells a wiz- 
ard can know from any particular spell 
level. Once a wizard has learned the maxi- 
mum number of spells he is allowed in a 
given spell level, he cannot add any more 
spells of that level to his spell book (unless 
the optional spell research system is used). 
Once a spell is learned, it cannot be un- 
learned and replaced by a new spell. 

For example, Delsenora the mage has an 
Intelligence of 14. She currently knows 
seven 3rd-level spells. During an adven- 
ture, she finds a musty old spell book on 
the shelves of a dank, forgotten library. 
Blowing away the dust, she sees a 3rd-level 

she has never seen before! Excited, 
she sits down and carefully studies the ar- 
cane notes. Her chance to learn the spell is 
60 percent. Rolling the dice, Delsenora’s 
player rolls a 37, She understands the curi- 
ous instructions and can copy them into 
her own spell book. When she is finished, 
she has eight 3rd-level spells, only one 
away from her maximum number. If the 
die roll had been greater than 60, or she al- 
ready had nine 3rd-level spells in her spell 
book, or the spell had been greater than 
7th level (the maximum level her Intelli- 
gence allows her to learn), she could not 
have added it to her collection. 


Spell Immunity is gained by those with 
exceptionally high Intelligence scores. 
Those with the immunity notice some in- 
consistency or inexactness in the illusion or 
phantasm, automatically allowing them to 
make their saving throws. All benefits are 
cumulative, thus a character with a 20 Intel- 
ligence is not fooled by 1st- or 2nd-level illu- 
sion spells. 


Wisdom 


Wisdom (Wis) de- 
scribes a composite of the character's en- 
lightenment, judgment, guile, willpower, 
common sense, and intuition. It can affect 
the character's resistance to magical attack. 
It is the prime requisite of priests; those with 
a Wisdom score of 16 or higher gain a 10 
percent bonus to experience points earned. 
Clerics, druids, and other priests with Wis- 
dom scores of 13 or higher also gain bonus 
spells over and above the number they are 
normally allowed to use. 

Magical Defense Adjustment listed on 
Table 5 applies to saving throws against 
magical spells that attack the mind: beguil- 
ing, charm, fear, hypnosis, illusions, posses- 
sion, suggestion, etc. These bonuses and 
penalties are applied automatically, without 


Ability Scores (Wisdom) i 


any conscious effort from the character. 

Bonus Spells indicates the number of ad- 
ditional spells a priest (and only a priest) is 
entitled to because of his extreme Wisdom. 
Note that these spells are available only 
when the priest is entitled to spells of the ap- 
propriate level. Bonus spells are cumula- 
tive, so a priest with a Wisdom of 15 is 
entitled to two Ist-level bonus spells and 
one 2nd-level bonus spell. 

Chance of Spell Failure states the percent- 
age chance that any particular spell fails 
when cast. Priests with low Wisdom scores 


percentile dice every time the priest casts a 
spell; if the number rolled is less than or 
equal to the listed chance for spell failure, 
the spell is expended with absolutely no ef- 
fect whatsoever. Note that priests with Wis- 
dom scores of 13 or higher don’t need to 
worry about their spells failing. 

Spell Immunity gives those extremely wise 
characters complete protection from certain 
spells, spell-like abilities, and magical items as 
listed. These immunities are cumulative, so 
that a character with a Wisdom of 23 is im- 
mune to all listed spells up to and including 


run the risk of having their spells fizzle. Roll those listed on the 23 Wisdom row.

The Charisma (Cha) 
score measures a character's persuasiveness, 
personal magnetism, and ability to lead. It is 
not a reflection of physical attractiveness, al- 
though attractiveness certainly plays a role. 
It is important to all characters, but espe- 
cially to those who must deal with non- 
player characters (NPCs), mercenary 
hirelings, retainers, and intelligent monsters. 
It dictates the total number of henchmen a 
character can retain and affects the loyalty of 
henchmen, hirelings, and retainers. 

Maximum Number of Henchmen states 
the number of non-player characters who 
will serve as permanent retainers of the 
player character. It does not affect the num- 


17 


servitors, or other persons in the pay of the 
character. 

Loyalty Base shows the subtraction from 
or addition to the henchmen’s and other ser- 
vitors’ loyalty scores (in the DMG). This is 
crucial during battles, when morale be- 
comes important. 

Reaction Adjustment indicates the pen- 
alty or bonus due to the character because 
of Charisma when dealing with non-player 
characters and intelligent creatures. For ex- 
ample, Rath encounters a centaur, an intelli- 
gent creature. Rath’s Charisma is only 6, so 
he is starting off with one strike against him. 
He probably should try to overcome this 
slight handicap by making generous offers 
of gifts or information.

What the Numbers Mean 


Now that you have 
finished creating the ability scores for your 
character, stop and take a look at them. 
What does all this mean? 

Suppose you decide to name your charac- 
ter “Rath” and you rolled the following abil- 
ity scores for him: 


Strength 8 
Dexterity 14 
Constitution 13 
Intelligence 13 
Wisdom 7 
Charisma 6 


Rath has strengths and weaknesses, but it 
is up to you to interpret what the numbers 
mean. Here are just two different ways these 
numbers could be interpreted. 

1) Although Rath is in good health (Con 
13), he’s not very strong (Str 8) because he's 
just plain lazy—he never wanted to exercise 
as a youth and now it's too late. His low 
Wisdom and Charisma scores (7, 6) show 
that he lacks the common sense to apply 
himself properly and projects a slothful, 


“I'm not going to bother” attitude (which 
tends to irritate others). Fortunately, Rath’s 
natural wit (Int 13) and Dexterity (14) keep 
him from being a total loss. 

Thus you might play Rath as an irritat- 
ing, smart-alecky twerp forever ducking 
just out of range of those who want to 


2) Rath has several good points—he has 
studied hard (Int 13) and practiced his man- 
ual skills (Dex 14). Unfortunately, his 
Strength is low (8) from a lack of exercise 
(all those hours spent reading books). 
Despite that, Rath’s health is still good (Con 
13). His low Wisdom and Charisma (7, 6) 
are a result of his lack of contact and 
involvement with people outside the realm 
of academics. 

Looking at the scores this way, you could 
play Rath as a kindly, naive, and shy profes- 
sorial type who's a good tinkerer, always 
fiddling with new ideas and inventions. 

Obviously, Rath’s ability scores (often 
called “stats”) are not the greatest in the 
world. Yet it is possible to turn these “disap- 
pointing” stats into a character who is both 
interesting and fun to play. Too often play- 
ers become obsessed with “good” stats. 
These players immediately give up on a 
character if he doesn’t have a majority of 


above-average scores. There are even those 
who feel a character is hopeless if he does 
not have at least one ability of 17 or higher! 
Needless to say, these players would never 
consider playing a character with an ability 
score of 6 or 7. 

In truth, Rath’s survivability has a lot less 
to do with his ability scores than with your 
desire to role-play him. If you give up on 
him, of course he won't survive! But if you 
take an interest in the character and role- 
play him well, then even a character with 
the lowest possible scores can present a fun, 
challenging, and all-around exciting time. 
Does he have a Charisma of 5? Why? May- 
be he's got an ugly scar. His table manners 
could be atrocious. He might mean well but 
always manage to say the wrong thing at the 
wrong time. He could be bluntly honest to 
the point of rudeness, something not likely 
to endear him to most people. His Dexterity 
is a 3? Why? Is he naturally clumsy or blind 
as a bat? 

Don’t give up on a character just because 
he has a low score. Instead, view it as an 
opportunity to role-play, to create a unique 
and entertaining personality in the game. 
Not only will you have fun creating that 
personality, but other players and the DM 
will have fun reacting to him. 


Chapter 2: Player Character Races 


After creating your character's ability 
scores, you must select a player character 
race. This is not a race in the true sense of 
the word: caucasian, black, asian, etc. It is 
actually a fantasy species for your 
character—human, elf, dwarf, gnome, half- 
elf, or halfling. Each race is different. Each 
possesses special powers and has different 
lists of classes to choose from. 

All six of the standard races are described 
in detail in this chapter. In many cases, 
broad statements are made concerning the 
race in general. Players are not bound by 
these generalities. For example, the state- 
ment that “dwarves tend to be dour and tac- 
iturn” does not mean that your character 
cannot be a jolly dwarf. It means that the 
garden-variety dwarf is dour and taciturn. 
If player characters were just like everyone 
else, they wouldn't be adventurers. Make 
your character unique and he will be more 
fun to play. 


Minimum and Maximum 
Ability Scores 


All non-human PC 
races (also called “demihuman” races) have 
minimum and maximum requirements for 
their ability scores. If you want to have a de- 
mihuman character, the character's ability 
scores must be within the allowable range. 
The minimums and maximums for each race 
are listed on Table 7 (the minimums are 
listed before the slash; the maximums are 
listed after the slash). Your character's sex 
has no effect on these minimums or maxi- 
mums. 

Consult Table 7 before making any racial 
adjustments to your character's ability 
scores. If the basic scores that you rolled up 
meet the requirements for a particular race, 
your character can be of that race, even if 
later modifications change the ability scores 
so they exceed the maximums or don’t meet 
the minimums. Once you satisfy the re- 
quirements at the start, you never have to 
worry about them again. 

Table 7 gives the minimum and maximum 
scores a newly created character must have 
to be a member of a demihuman race. Any 
character can be a human, if the player so 
desires. 


Table 7: RACIAL ABILITY REQUIREMENTS 


Ability Dwarf Elf 
Strength 8/18 3/18 
Dexterity 3/17 6/18 
Wisdom 3/18 3/18 
Charisma 3/17 8/18 


Racial Ability Adjustments 


If you chose to 
make your character a dwarf, elf, gnome, or 
halfling, you now have to adjust some of 
your character's ability scores. The adjust- 
ments are mandatory; all characters of these 
races receive the adjustments. Even if ad- 
justments raise or lower your character's 
ability scores beyond the minimums and 
maximums shown on Table 7, you do not 
have to pick a new race. The adjustments 
can also raise a score to 19 or lower it to 2. 


Table 8: RACIAL ABILITY 


ADJUSTMENTS 
Race Adjustments 
Dwarf +1 Constitution; —1 Charisma 
Elf +1 Dexterity; —1 Constitution

Halfling +1 Dexterity; —1 Strength 


Class Restrictions and Level Limits 


The human race 
has one special ability in the AD&D® game: 
Humans can choose to be of any class— 
warrior, wizard, priest, or rogue—and can 
rise to great level in any class. The other 
races have fewer choices of character classes 
and usually are limited in the level they can 
attain. These restrictions reflect the natural 
tendencies of the races (dwarves like war 
and fighting and dislike magic, etc.). The 
limits are high enough so a demihuman can 
achieve power and importance in at least 
one class. A halfling, for example, can be- 
come the best thief in the land, but he can- 
not become a great fighter. 

The limits also exist for play balance. The 
ability of humans to assume any role and 
reach any level is their only advantage. The 
demihuman races have other powers that 
make them entertaining to play— 
particularly the ability to be multi-classed 
(see Glossary). These powers balance the 
enjoyment of play against the ability to rise 
in level. Ask your DM for the level limits 
imposed on non-human characters. 


* Halfling fighters do not roll for exceptional Strength.

Languages 


Racial languages 
for demihumans can be handled in either of 
two ways, depending on whether or not 
your DM uses the optional proficiency sys- 
tem. Either way, your character automati- 
cally knows his native language. 

Without the proficiency system, your 
character starts adventuring already know- 
ing a number of additional languages (the 
number depends on his Int score, see Table 
4). The additional languages must be chosen 
from among those listed in his race's de- 
scription. 


If you use the proficiency system, your 
character receives additional 

by using proficiency slots (see page 51) to 
determine how many languages he 
knows when he starts adventuring (his 
native language does not cost a slot). De- 
mihumans must choose these 

from among those listed in the following 
racial descriptions. 


Human PCs generally start the game 
knowing only their regional language—the 
language they grew up speaking. The DM 
may decide to allow beginning PCs addi- 
tional languages (up to their Int score limit 
or proficiency slot limit), if he feels the PCs 
had the opportunity to learn these as they 
grew up. Otherwise, human PCs may learn 
additional languages as they adventure. 


Dwarves 


Dwarves are short, 
stocky fellows, easily identified by their size 
and shape. They average 4 to 41/2 feet tall. 
They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and 
dark hair. Dwarves generally live for 350 
years. 

Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. 
They are given to hard work and care little 
for most humor. They are strong and brave. 
They enjoy beer, ale, mead, and even 
stronger drink. Their chief love, however, is 
precious metal, particularly gold. They 
prize gems, of course, especially diamonds 
and opaque gems (except pearls, which they 
do not like), Dwarves like the earth and dis- 
like the sea. Not overly fond of elves, they 
have a fierce hatred of orcs and goblins. 
Their short, stocky builds make them ill- 
suited for riding horses or other large 
mounts (although ponies present no diffi- 
culty), so they tend to be a trifle dubious 
and wary of these creatures. They are ill- 
disposed toward magic and have little talent 
for it, but revel in fighting, warcraft, and 
scientific arts such as engineering. 

Though dwarves are suspicious and ava- 
ricious, their courage and tenacity more 
than compensate for these shortcomings. 


Dwarves typically dwell in hilly or moun- 
tainous regions. They prefer life in the com- 
forting gloom and solidness that is found 
underground. They have several special 
abilities that relate to their underground 
life, and they are noted for being particular- 
ly resistant to magics and poisons. 

A character of the dwarven race can be a 
cleric, a fighter, or a thief. He can also 
choose to be a fighter/cleric or fighter/thief. 

From living underground, dwarves have 
found it useful to learn the languages of sev- 
eral of their neighbors, both friendly and 
hostile. The initial languages a dwarf can 
learn are common, dwarf, gnome, goblin, 
kobold, orc, and any others your DM 
allows. The actual number of languages is 
limited by the Intelligence of the player 
character (see Table 4) or by the proficiency 
slots he allots to languages (if that optional 
system is used). 

By nature, dwarves are nonmagical and 
never use magical spells (clerical spells are 
allowed however). This gives a bonus to 
dwarves’ saving throws against attacks 
from magical wands, staves, rods, and 
spells. This bonus is +1 for every 31/2 
points of Constitution score. Thus, for 
example, if a dwarf has a Constitution score 
of 7 he gains +2 on saving throws. These 
bonuses are summarized on Table 9. 


Table 9: CONSTITUTION SAVING 


THROW BONUSES 
Constitution Score Saving Throw Bonus 
4-6 goat 
7-10 +2 
11-13 +3 
14-17 +4 
18-19 +5 


Similarly, dwarves have exceptional 
resistance to toxic substances. All dwarven 
characters make saving throws against poi- 
son with the same bonuses that they get 
against magical attacks (see Table 9). 

Also because of their nonmagical nature, 
however, dwarves have trouble using magi- 
cal items. All magical items that are not spe- 
cifically suited to the character's class have a 
20 percent chance to malfunction when used 
by a dwarf. This check is made each time a 
dwarf uses a magical item. A malfunction 
affects only the current use; the item may 
work properly next time. For devices that 
are continually in operation, the check is 
made the first time the device is used during 
an encounter. If the check is passed, the 
device functions normally until it is turned 
off. Thus a dwarf would have to check upon 
donning a robe of blending but would not 
check again until he had taken the robe off 
and then put it on again. If a cursed item 
malfunctions, the character recognizes its 
cursed nature and can dispose of the item. 
Malfunction applies to rods, staves, wands, 
rings, amulets, potions, horns, jewels, and 


all other magical items except weapons, 
shields, armor, gauntlets, and girdles. This 
penalty does not apply to dwarven clerics 
using clerical items. 

In melee, dwarves add 1 to their dice rolls 
to hit orcs, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgob- 
lins. When ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, 
or titans attack dwarves, these monsters 
must subtract 4 from their attack rolls 
because of the dwarves’ small size and com- 
bat ability against these much bigger crea- 
tures. 

Dwarven infravision enables them to see 
up to 60 feet in the dark. 

Dwarves are miners of great skill. While 
underground, they can detect the following 
information when within 10 feet of the par- 
ticular phenomenon (but they can deter- 
mine their approximate depth below the 
surface at any time). 


Detect grade or slope 

in passage 1-5 on 1d6 
Detect new tunnel/passage 

construction 1-5 on 1d6 
Detect sliding/shifting walls 

or rooms 1-4 on 1d6 
Detect stonework traps, pits, 

and deadfalls 1-3 on 1d6 
Determine approx. depth 

underground 1-3 on 1d6 


Note that the dwarf must deliberately try 
to make these determinations; the informa- 
tion does not simply spring to mind unbid- 
den. 

Because of their sturdy builds, dwarves 
add 1 to their initial Constitution scores. 
Their dour and suspicious natures cause 
them to subtract 1 from their initial Cha- 
risma scores. 


Elves 


Elves tend to be 
somewhat shorter and slimmer than normal 
humans. Their features are finely chiseled 
and delicate, and they speak in melodic 
tones. Although they appear fragile and 
weak, as a race they are quick and strong. 
Elves often live to be over 1,200 years old, 
although long before this time they feel 
compelled to depart the realms of men and 
mortals. Where they go is uncertain, but it is 
an undeniable urge of their race. 

Elves are often considered frivolous and 
aloof. In fact, they are not, although 
humans often find their personalities impos- 
sible to fathom. They concern themselves 
with natural beauty, dancing and frolicking, 
playing and singing, unless necessity dic- 
tates otherwise. They are not fond of ships 
or mines, but enjoy growing things and gaz- 
ing at the open sky. Even though elves tend 
toward haughtiness and arrogance at times, 
they regard their friends and associates as 
equals. They do not make friends easily, but 


21 


a friend (or enemy) is never forgotten. They 
prefer to distance themselves from humans, 
have little love for dwarves, and hate the 
evil denizens of the woods. 

Their humor is clever, as are their songs 
and poetry. Elves are brave but never fool- 
hardy. They eat sparingly; they drink mead 
and wine, but seldom to excess. While they 
find well-wrought jewelry a pleasure to 
behold, they are not overly interested in 
money or gain. They find magic and sword- 
play (or any refined combat art) fascinating. 
If they have a weakness it lies in these inter- 
ests. 

There are five branches of the elven 
race: aquatic, gray, high, wood, and dark. 
Elf player characters are always assumed to 
be of the most common type—high elves— 
although a character can be another type of 
elf with the DM's permission (but the choice 
grants no additional powers). To the eye of 
outsiders, the differences between the 
groups are mostly cosmetic, but most elves 
maintain that there are important cultural 
differences between the various groups. 
Aquatic elves spend their lives beneath the 
waves and have adapted to these condi- 
tions. Gray elves are considered the most 
noble and serious-minded of this breed. 
High elves are the most common. Wood 
elves are considered to be wild, tempera- 
mental, and savage. All others hold that the 
subterranean dark elves are corrupt and 
evil, no longer part of the elven community. 

A player character elf can be a cleric, 
fighter, mage, thief, or ranger. In addition, 
an elf can choose to be a multi-class fighter/ 
mage, fighter/thief, fighter/mage/thief, or 
mage/thief. (The rules governing these 
combinations are explained under Multi- 
Class Characters, page 44.) 

Elves have found it useful to learn the lan- 
guages of several of the forest's children, 
both the good and the bad. As initial lan- 
guages, an elf can choose common, elf, 
gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, 
and gnoll. The number of languages an elf 
can learn is limited by his Intelligence (see 
Table 4) or the proficiency slots he allots to 
languages (if that optional system is used). 

Elven characters have 90 percent resist- 
ance to sleep and all charm-related spells. 
(See Chapter 9: Combat for an explanation 
of magic resistance.) This is in addition to 
the normal saving throw allowed against a 
charm spell. 

When employing a bow of any sort other 
than a crossbow, or when using a short or 
long sword, elves gain a bonus of +1 to 
their attack rolls. 

An elf can gain a bonus to surprise oppo- 
nents, but only if the elf is not in metal 
armor. Even then, the elf must either be 
alone, or with a party comprised only of 
elves or halflings (also not in metal armor), 
or 90 feet or more away from his party (the 
group of characters he is with) to gain this 


Races (Gnomes) 


bonus. If he fulfills these conditions, he 
moves so silently that opponents suffer a 
—4 penalty to their surprise die rolls. If the 
elf must open a door or screen to attack, this 
penalty is reduced to —2. 

Elven infravision enables them to see up 
to 60 feet in darkness. 

Secret doors (those constructed so as to 
be hard to notice) and concealed doors 
(those hidden from sight by screens, cur- 
tains, or the like) are difficult to hide from 
elves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a 
concealed door gives an elven character a 
one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on 1d6) to notice 
it. If actively searching for such doors, elven 
characters have a one-in-three chance (roll a 
1 or 2 on 1d6) to find a secret door and a 
one-in-two chance (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d6) 
to discover a concealed portal. 

As stated previously, elven characters 
add 1 to their initial Dexterity scores. Like- 
wise, as elves are not as sturdy as humans, 
they deduct 1 from their initial Constitution 
scores. 


Gnomes 


Kin to dwarves, 
gnomes are noticeably smaller than their 
distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly 
maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. 
Their noses, however, are significantly 
larger. Most gnomes have dark tan or 
brown skin and white hair. A typical gnome 
lives for 350 years. 

Gnomes have lively and sly senses of hu- 
mor, especially for practical jokes. They 
have a great love of living things and finely 
wrought items, particularly gems and jew- 
elry. Gnomes love all sorts of precious 
stones and are masters of gem polishing and 
cutting. 

Gnomes prefer to live in areas of rolling, 
rocky hills, well wooded and uninhabited 
by humans. Their diminutive stature has 
made them suspicious of the larger races— 
humans and elves—although they are not 
hostile, They are sly and furtive with those 
they do not know or trust, and somewhat 
reserved even under the best of circum- 
stances. Dwelling in mines and burrows, 
they are sympathetic to dwarves, but find 
their cousins’ aversion to surface dwellers 
foolish. 

A gnome character can elect to be a 
fighter, a thief, a cleric, or an illusionist. A 
gnome can have two classes, but not three: 
fighter/thief, illusionist/thief, etc. 

Due to his upbringing, a beginning gnome 
character can choose to know the following 
languages, in addition to any others allowed 
by the DM: common, dwarf, gnome, half- 
ling, goblin, kobold, and the simple com- 
mon speech of burrowing mammals (moles, 
badgers, weasels, shrews, ground squirrels, 
etc.). The actual number of languages a 
character begins with depends upon his In- 


telligence score (see Table 4) or the profi- 
ciency slots he allots to languages (if that 
optional system is used). 

Like their cousins the dwarves, gnomes 
are highly magic resistant. A gnome player 
character gains a bonus of +1 for every 31/2 
points of Constitution score, just as 
dwarves do (see Table 9). This bonus ap- 
plies to saving throws against magical 
wands, staves, rods, and spells. 

Gnomes also suffer a 20 percent chance 
for failure every time they use any magical 
item except weapons, armor, shields, illu- 
sionist items, and (if the character is a thief) 
items that duplicate thieving abilities. This 
check is made each time the gnome attempts 
to use the device or, in the case of 
continuous-use devices, each time the de- 
vice is activated. Like dwarves, gnomes can 
sense a cursed item if the device fails to func- 
tion. 

In melee, gnome characters add 1 to their 
attack rolls to hit kobolds or goblins. When 
gnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, ogre magi, 
giants, or titans attack gnomes, these mon- 
sters must subtract 4 from their attack rolls 
because of the gnomes’ small size and their 
combat skills against these much larger 
creatures. 

Gnomish infravision enables them to see 
up to 60 feet in the dark. 

Being tunnelers of exceptional merit, 
gnomes are able to detect the following 
within 10 feet (exception: They can deter- 
mine their approximate depth or direction 
underground at any time.). They must stop 
and concentrate for one round to use any of 
these abilities. 


Detect grade or slope 

in passage 1-5 on 1d6 
Detect unsafe walls, ceiling, 

and floors 1-7 on 1d10 
Determine approx. depth 

underground 1-4 on 1d6 
Determine approx. direction 

underground 1-3 on 1d6 


Gnome characters gain a +1 bonus to 
their Intelligence scores, to reflect their 
highly inquisitive natures. They suffer a —1 
penalty to Wisdom because their curiosity 
often leads them unknowingly into danger. 


Half-Elves 


Half-elves are the 
most common mixed-race beings. The rela- 
tionship between elf, human, and half-elf is 
defined as follows: 1) Anyone with both el- 
ven and human ancestors is either a human 
or a half-elf (elves have only elven ances- 
tors). 2) If there are more human ancestors 
than elven, the person is human; if there are 
equal numbers or more elves, the person is 
half-elven. 

Half-elves are usually much like their el- 
ven parent in appearance. They are hand- 


22 


some folk, with the good features of each of 
their races. They mingle freely with either 
race, being only slightly taller than the aver- 
age elf (5 feet 6 inches on average) and 
weighing about 150 pounds. They typically 
live about 160 years. They do not have all 
the abilities of the elf, nor do they have the 
flexibility of unlimited level advancement of 
the human. Finally, in some of the less- 
civilized nations, half-elves are viewed with 
suspicion and superstition. 

In general, a half-elf has the curiosity, in- 
ventiveness, and ambition of his human an- 
cestors and the refined senses, love of 
nature, and artistic tastes of his elven ances- 
tors. 

Half-elves do not form communities 
among themselves; rather, they can be 
found living in both elven and human com- 
munities. The reactions of humans and elves 
to half-elves ranges from intrigued fascina- 
tion to outright bigotry. 

Of all the demihuman races, half-elves 
have the greatest range of choices in charac- 
ter class, They tend to make good druids 
and rangers. A half-elf can choose to be a 
cleric, druid, fighter, ranger, mage, special- 
ist wizard, thief, or bard. In addition, a half- 
elf can choose from the following 
multi-class combinations: cleric (or druid)/ 
fighter, cleric (or druid)/fighter/mage, 
cleric (or druid)/ranger, cleric (or druid)/ 
mage, fighter/mage, fighter/thief, fighter/ 
mage/thief, and mage/thief. The half-elf 
must abide by the rules for multi-class char- 
acters. 

Half-elves do not have a language of their 
own. Their extensive contact with other 
races enables them to choose any of the fol- 
lowing languages (plus any other allowed 
by the DM): common, elf, gnome, halfling, 
goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll. The ac- 
tual number of languages the character 
knows is limited by his Intelligence (see Ta- 
ble 4) or by the number of proficiency slots 
he allots to languages (if that optional sys- 
tem is used). 

Half-elven characters have a 30 percent 
resistance to sleep and all charm-related 
spells. 

Half-elven infravision enables them to see 
up to 60 feet in darkness. 

Secret or concealed doors are difficult to 
hide from half-elves, just as they are from 
elves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a 
concealed door (one hidden by obstructing 
curtains, etc.) gives the half-elven character 
a one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on 1d6) of spot- 
ting it. If the character is actively seeking to 
discover hidden doors, he has a one-in-three 
chance (roll a 1 or 2 on 1d6) of spotting a se- 
cret door (one constructed to be undetect- 
able) and a one-in-two chance (roll a 1, 2, or 
3 on 1d6) of locating a concealed door. 


Races (Halflings) 


Halflings are short, 
generally plump people, very much like 
small humans. Their faces are round and 
broad and often quite florid. Their hair is 
typically curly and the tops of their feet are 
covered with coarse hair. They prefer not to 
wear shoes whenever possible. Their typical 
life expectancy is approximately 150 years. 

Halflings are sturdy and industrious, gen- 
erally quiet and peaceful. Overall they pre- 
fer the comforts of home to dangerous 
adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough 
humor, and homespun stories. In fact, they 
can be a trifle boring at times. Halflings are 
not forward, but they are observant and 
conversational if in friendly company. Half- 
lings see wealth only as a means of gaining 
creature comforts, which they love. Though 
they are not overly brave or ambitious, they 
are generally honest and hard working 
when there is need. 

Halfling homes are well-furnished bur- 
rows, although most of their work is done 
on the surface. Elves generally like them ina 
patronizing sort of way. Dwarves cheerfully 
tolerate them, thinking halflings somewhat 
soft and harmless. Gnomes, although they 
drink more and eat less, like halflings best, 
feeling them kindred spirits. Because half- 
lings are more open and outgoing than any 
of these other three, they get along with oth- 
er races far better. 

There are three types of halflings: Hair- 
feets, Tallfellows, and Stouts. Hairfeets are 
the most common type, but for player char- 
acters, any of the three is acceptable. 

A halfling character can choose to be a 
cleric, fighter, thief, or a multi-class fighter/ 
thief. The halfling must use the rules provid- 
ed for multi-class characters. 

Through their contact with other races, 
halfling characters are allowed to choose 
initial languages from common, halfling, 
dwarf, elf, gnome, goblin, and orc, in addi- 
tion to any other languages the DM allows. 
The actual number of languages the charac- 
ter knows is limited by his Intelligence (see 
Table 4) or by the number of proficiency 
slots he allots to languages (if that optional 
system is used). 

All halfling characters have a high resist- 
ance to magical spells, so for every 31/2 
points of Constitution score, the character 
gains a +1 bonus on saving throws vs. 
wands, staves, rods, and spells. These 
bonuses are summarized on Table 9. 

Halflings have a similar resistance to poi- 
sons of all sorts, so they gain a Constitution 
bonus identical to that for saving throws vs. 
magical attacks when they make saving 
throws vs. poison (i.e., +1 to +5, depend- 
ing on Constitution score). 

Halflings have a natural talent with slings 
and thrown weapons. Rock pitching is a 
favorite sport of many a halfling child. All 


halflings gain a +1 bonus to their attack 
rolls when using thrown weapons and 
slings. 

A halfling can gain a bonus to surprise 
opponents, but only if the halfling is not in 
metal armor. Even then, the halfling must 
either be alone, or with a party comprised 
only of halflings or elves, or 90 feet or more 
away from his party to gain this bonus. If he 
fulfills any of these conditions, he causes a 
—4 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls. If a 
door or other screen must be opened, this 
penalty is reduced to —2. 

Depending on their lineage, certain half- 
ling characters have infravision. Any half- 
ling character has a 15 percent chance to 
have normal infravision (this means he is 
pure Stout), out to 60 feet; failing that 
chance, there is a 25 percent chance that he 
has limited infravision (mixed Stout/ 
Tallfellow or Stout/Hairfeets lineage), effec- 
tive out to 30 feet. 

Similarly, halflings with any Stoutish 
blood can note if a passage is an up or down 
grade with 75 percent accuracy (roll a 1, 2, 
or 3 on 1d4). They can determine direction 
half the time (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d6). These 
abilities function only when the character is 
concentrating on the desired information to 
the exclusion of all else, and only if the char- 
acter is pure or partially Stout. 

Halfling characters have a penalty of —1 
to their initially generated Strength scores, 
and they gain a bonus of +1 to Dexterity. 


Although humans 
are treated as a single race in the AD&D® 
game, they come in all the varieties we 
know on Earth. A human PC can have 
whatever racial characteristics the DM 
allows. 

Humans have only one special ability: 
They can be of any character class and rise 
to any level in any class. Other PC races 
have limited choices in these areas. 

Humans are also more social and tolerant 
than most other races, accepting the compa- 
ny of elves, dwarves, and the like with 
noticeably less complaint. 

Because of these abilities and tendencies, 
humans have become significant powers 
within the world and often rule empires that 
other races (because of their racial tenden- 
cies) would find difficult to manage. 


Other Characteristics 


After you have 
selected a race, you may want to fill in the 
details of your character. You are not 
required to do so, but there are many situa- 
tions in which this information is vital or 
useful to role-playing. 

The sex and name of your character are 
up to you. Your character can be of the same 


23 


sex as yourself or of the opposite sex. 

Some people feel it is important to know 
whether their character is right- or left- 
handed. Actually, this has no bearing on the 
play of the game, since all characters are 
assumed to be reasonably competent with 
either hand (that doesn’t mean everyone is 
trained to fight with two weapons). It is easiest 
to say that your character has the same hand- 
edness as you. This will result in the normal 
ratio of right- to left-handed people. 

On occasion it may be useful to know 
your character's height and weight. The best 
way to determine height and weight is to 
choose the appropriate numbers, subject to 
your DM's approval. If you want a short, 
pudgy human fighter, you can select an 
appropriate height and weight. Otherwise, 
heights and weights can be generated ran- 
domly using Table 10 (next page). Take the 
appropriate base score and add the die roll 
modifier. As with all tables, this can create 
some ridiculous results (one of the problems 
with randomness) and, at the same time, 
cannot account for the full variety of man- 
kind (or demihumankind). The table only 
reproduces a fairly average range for each 
race. Heights and weights for demihuman 
races not listed on the table must be decided 
by your DM. 


The tallest man on record stood 8 feet 
11.1 inches, while the tallest woman was 
8 feet 1.25 inches. The shortest man was 


ighed ad 
and shied only 6c tne The heaviest 
woman is thought to have weighed 880 
pounds. Obviously, these figures indi- 
cate that there is a great deal of variety 
possible for player characters. 


Players may also want to know their 
characters’ starting ages. Human characters 
can start at any age that is agreeable to both 
the player and the DM. However, all begin- 
ning adventurers are assumed to be at least 
16 years old, since they must grow physi- 
cally, emotionally, and in practical experi- 
ence before they are ready to undertake the 
rigors of an adventuring life. Table 11 can be 
used to give a starting age (add the variable 
die roll to the base starting age to get the 
character's starting age) and the possible life 
span of a character, assuming a quiet and 
peaceful life. Humans are also included on 
this list in case you want to determine their 
ages randomly. The maximum age for a 
character should be secretly determined and 
recorded by the DM. Player characters may 
have an idea of how long they expect to live, 
but do not know their true allotted life 
spans. 


> af Races (Characteristics) 


As a character ages, his ability scores are 
affected. Upon reaching one-half of his base 
maximum age (45 for a human), the charac- 
ter loses 1 point of Strength (or half of his 
exceptional Strength rating) and 1 point of 
Constitution, but gains 1 point each of Intel- 
ligence and Wisdom. At two-thirds of his 
base maximum age (60 for a human), the 
character loses 2 more points of Strength (or 
all his exceptional Strength and 1 point 
more), 2 points of Dexterity, and 1 more 
point of Constitution, but he gains 1 point 
of Wisdom. Upon reaching the base maxi- 
mum age, the character loses 1 more point 
from each of Strength, Dexterity, and Con- 
stitution, while gaining 1 more point in both 
Intelligence and Wisdom. All aging adjust- 
ments are cumulative. See Table 12 for a 
summary of these effects. 


Although many people have claimed to 
live to great ages, the oldest human of 

i age was 113 years old in 1988 
and is still alive! 


There may be times when a magical 
device or spell adds years to or subtracts 
years from a player character's life. This 
magical aging can have two different 
effects. Some magical aging physically 
affects the character. For example, a haste 
spell ages those it affects by one year. This 
aging is added directly to the player charac- 
ter’s current age. He physically acquires the 
appearance of himself one year older (a few 
more wrinkles, etc.), Characters who 
increase in age from magical effects do not 
gain the benefits of increased Wisdom and 
Intelligence—these are a function of the pas- 
sage of game time—but the character does 
suffer the physical losses to Strength, Dex- 
terity, and Constitution associated with 
aging. These are breakdowns of the body's 
systems. Physical age can also be removed 
in the same manner. Some potions give 
years back to the character. In this case, the 
physical appearance of the character is 
restored. The character can regain lost vigor 
(Str, Dex, and Con) as his body is renewed 
but he does not lose any of the benefits of 
aging (Wis and Int). 

Magical aging can also work to increase 
or decrease the life span of the character. In 
such a case, the actual age of the character is 
unaffected. All adjustments are made by the 
DM to the character's maximum age (which 
only the DM knows). For example, a human 
finds a magical fountain that bestows great 
longevity (10 to 60 years more), The DM 
has already determined the human will nat- 
urally live to 103 years (base 90 + 2d20, in 
this case 13). The water of the fountain 
bestows 40 more years so that, unless the 
character meets a violent end, he will live to 
143 years. He still suffers the effects of aging 
at the usual ages (45, 60, and 90 years, 


respectively), but the period in which he 
would be considered a venerable elder of his 
people is extended for 40 years. 

There are a number of other personal 
characteristics your character has—hair 
and eye color, body shape, voice, noticeable 
features, and general personality. There are 
no tables for these things, nor should there 
be. Your job, as a player, is to add these 
details, thereby creating the type of charac- 
ter you want. You probably know some 
from the start (do you want to play a tower- 
ing, robust warrior, or a slim, unassuming 
swordsman?); others, especially your char- 
acter's personality, will grow and take form 
as you play. Remember, you are an actor 
and your character is your role!

Chapter 3: Player Character Classes 


After choosing your character's race, you 
select his character class. A character class is 
like a profession or career. It is what your 
character has worked and trained at during 
his younger years. If you wanted to become 
a doctor, you could not walk out the door 
and begin work immediately. First you 
would have to get some training. The same 
is true of character classes in the AD&D® 
game. Your character is assumed to have 
some previous training and guidance before 
beginning his adventuring career. Now, 
armed with a little knowledge, your charac- 
ter is ready to make his name and fortune. 

The character classes are divided into 
four groups according to general occupa- 
tions: warrior, wizard, priest, and rogue. 
Within each group are several similar char- 
acter classes. All classes within a group 
share the same Hit Dice, as well as combat 
and saving throw progressions. Each char- 
acter class within a group has different spe- 
cial powers and abilities that are available 
only to that class. Each player must select a 
group for his character, then a specific class 
within that group. 


Warrior Wizard Priest Rogue 
Fighter Mage Cleric Thief 
Ranger Illusionist Druid Bard 
Paladin Other Other 
etna mage, cleric, and thief are the 
standard classes. They are historical and 
legendary archetypes that are common 
to many different cultures. Thus they are 


ys aga to any sort of AD&D game 
campaign. All of the other classes are op- 
tional. Your DM may decide that one or 
more of the optional classes are not ap- 
propriate to his campaign setting. Check 
with your DM before selecting an op- 
tional character class. 


To help you choose your character's class, 
each group and its subordinate classes are 
described briefly. The groups and classes are 
described in detail later in this chapter. 

Warrior: There are three different classes 
within the warrior group: fighter, paladin, 
and ranger. All are well-trained in the use of 
weapons and skilled in the martial arts. 

The fighter is a champion, swordsman, 
soldier, and brawler. He lives or dies by his 
knowledge of weapons and tactics. Fighters 
can be found at the front of any battle, con- 
testing toe-to-toe with monsters and vil- 
lains. A good fighter needs to be strong and 
healthy if he hopes to survive. 

The paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the 
exemplar of everything good and true. Like 
the fighter, the paladin is a man of combat. 
However, the paladin lives for the ideals of 
righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and 
chivalry. He strives to be a living example of 
these virtues so that others might learn from 
him as well as gain by his actions. 


The ranger is a warrior and a woodsman. 
He is skilled with weapons and is knowl- 
edgeable in tracking and woodcraft. The 
ranger often protects and guides lost trav- 
elers and honest peasant-folk. A ranger 
needs to be strong and wise to the ways of 
nature to live a full life. 

Wizard: The wizard strives to be a master 
of magical energies, shaping them and cast- 
ing them as spells. To do so, he studies 
strange tongues and obscure facts and de- 
votes much of his time to magical research. 

A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit 
to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adven- 
turing without a retinue of fighters and 
men-at-arms. 

Because there are different types (or 
schools) of magic, there are different types 
of wizards. The mage studies all types of 
magic and learns a wide variety of spells. 
His broad range makes him well suited to 
the demands of adventuring. The illusionist 
is an example of how a wizard can specialize 
in a particular school of magic, illusion in 
this case. 

Priest: A priest sees to the spiritual needs 
of a community or location. Two types of 
priests—clerics and druids—are described 
in the Player's Handbook. Other types can 
be created by the DM to suit specific cam- 
paigns. 

The cleric is a generic priest (of any my- 
thos) who tends to the needs of a commu- 
nity. He is both protector and healer. He is 
not purely defensive, however. When evil 
threatens, the cleric is well-suited to seek it 
out on its own ground and destroy it. 

The druid class is optional; it is an exam- 
ple of how the priest can be adapted to a cer- 
tain type of setting. The druid serves the 
cause of nature and neutrality; the wilder- 
ness is his community. He uses his special 
powers to protect it and to preserve balance 
in the world. 

Rogue: The rogue can be found through- 
out the world, wherever people gather and 
money changes hands. While many rogues 
are motivated only by a desire to amass for- 
tune in the easiest way possible, some 
rogues have noble aims; they use their skills 
to correct injustice, spread good will, or 
contribute to the success of an adventuring 
group. 

There are two types of rogues: thieves 
and bards. 

To accomplish his goals, for good or ill, 
the thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nim- 
bleness, and stealth are his hallmarks. 
Whether he turns his talent against innocent 
passers-by and wealthy merchants or op- 
pressors and monsters is a choice for the 
thief to make. 

The bard is also a rogue, but he is very 
different from the thief. His strength is his 
pleasant and charming personality. With it 
and his wits he makes his way through the 
world, A bard is a talented musician and a 


25 


walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and 
lore. He learns a little bit about everything 
that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all- 
trades but master of none. While many 
bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs 
are welcome almost everywhere. 


Class Ability Score Requirements 


Each of the charac- 
ter classes has minimum scores in various 
abilities. A character must satisfy these min- 
imums to be of that class. If your character's 
scores are too low for him to belong to any 
character class, ask your DM for permission 
to reroll one or more of your ability scores 
or to create an entirely new character. If you 
desperately want your character to belong 
to a particular class but have scores that are 
too low, your DM might allow you to in- 
crease these scores to the minimum needed. 
However, you must ask him first. Don’t 
count on the DM allowing you to raise a 
score above 16 in any case.

Classes (Fighter) 


Class Descriptions 


The complete char- 
acter class descriptions that follow give the 
specific, detailed information you need 
about each class. These are organized ac- 
cording to groups. Information that applies 
to the entire group is presented at the start of 
the section. Each character class within the 
group is then explained. 

The descriptions use game terms that may 
be unfamiliar to you; many of these are ex- 
plained in this text (or you may look the 
terms up in the Glossary). 

Experience Points measure what a char- 
acter has learned and how he has improved 
his skill during the course of his adventures. 
Characters earn experience points by com- 
pleting adventures and by doing things spe- 
cifically related to their class. A fighter, for 
example, earns more experience for charg- 
ing and battling a monster than does a thief, 
because the fighter’s training emphasizes 
battle while the thief’s emphasizes stealth 
and cleverness. Characters accumulate ex- 
perience points from adventure to adven- 
ture. When they accumulate enough, they 
rise to the next level of experience, gaining 
additional abilities and powers. The experi- 
ence level tables for each character group 
list the total, accumulated experience points 
needed to reach each level. 


Some DMs may require that a character 
spend a certain amount of time or money 
training before rising to the next experi- 
ence level. Your DM will tell you the re- 
quirements for advancement when the 


Level is a measure of the character's power. 
A beginning character starts at 1st level. To ad- 
vance to the next level, the character must 
earn a requisite number of experience points. 
Different character classes improve at differ- 
ent rates. Each increase in level improves the 
character's survivability and skills. 

Prime Requisite is the ability score or 
scores that are most important to a particu- 
lar class. A fighter must be strong and a 
mage must be intelligent; their prime requi- 
sites, therefore, are Strength and Intelli- 
gence, respectively. Some character classes 
have more than one prime requisite. Any 
character who has a score of 16 or more in 
all his prime requisites gains a 10 percent bo- 
nus to his experience point awards. 


Warrior 
The warrior group 


encompasses the character classes of heroes 
who make their way in the world primarily 
by skill at arms: fighters, paladins, and 
rangers. 

Warriors are allowed to use any weapon. 
They can wear any type of armor. Warriors 


get 1 to 10 (1d10) hit points per level and can 
gain a special Constitution hit point bonus 
that is available only to warriors. 

The disadvantage warriors have is that 
they are restricted in their selection of magi- 
cal items and spells. 

All warriors use Table 14 to determine 
their advancement in level as they earn ex- 
perience points. 

All warriors gain one 10-sided hit die per 
level from Ist through 9th. After 9th level, 
warriors gain just 3 hit points per level and 
they no longer gain additional hit point bo- 
nuses for high Constitution scores.

All warriors gain the ability to make

ers can make per round, as a function of 
their levels.

Fighter 
Ability Requirements: Strength 9 
Prime Requisite: Strength 
Allowed Races: All 


The principal attribute of a fighter is 
Strength. To become a fighter, a character 
must have a minimum Strength score of 9. 
A good Dexterity rating is highly desirable. 

A fighter who has a Strength score (his 
prime requisite) of 16 or more gains a 10 per- 


26 


cent bonus to the experience points he earns. 

Also, high Strength gives the fighter a 
better chance to hit an opponent and en- 
ables him to cause more damage. 


The fighter is a warrior, an expert in weap- 
ons and, if he is clever, tactics and strategy. 


the Great, Charle- 
Y Richard the Lionheart, 
and Belisarius. Your fighter could be mod- 


eled after any of these, or he could be 
unique. A visit to your local library can 
uncover many heroic fighters. 


Fighters can have any alignment: good 
or evil, lawful or chaotic, or neutral. 

As a master of weapons, the fighter is the 
only character able to have weapon speciali- 
zation (explained in Chapter 5). Weapon 
specialization enables the fighter to use a 
particular weapon with exceptional skill, 
improving his chances to hit and cause dam- 
age with that weapon. A fighter character is 
not required to specialize in a weapon; the 
choice is up to the player. No other charac- 
ter class—not even ranger or paladin—is al- 
lowed weapon specialization. 

While fighters cannot cast magical spells, 
they can use many magical items, including 
potions, protection scrolls, most rings, and 
all forms of enchanted armor, weapons, and 
shields. 

When a fighter attains 9th level (becomes 
a “Lord"), he can automatically attract men- 
at-arms. These soldiers, having heard of the 
fighter, come for the chance to gain fame, 
adventure, and cash. They are loyal as long 
as they are well-treated, successful, and 
paid well. Abusive treatment or a disastrous 
campaign can lead to grumbling, desertion, 
and possibly mutiny. To attract the men, the 
fighter must have a castle or stronghold and 
sizeable manor lands around it. As he 
claims and rules this land, soldiers journey 
to his domain, thereby increasing his power. 
Furthermore, the fighter can tax and de- 
velop these lands, gaining a steady income 
from them. Your DM has information about 
gaining and running a barony. 

In addition to regular men-at-arms, the 
9th-level fighter also attracts an elite body- 
guard (his “household guards”), Although 
these soldiers are still mercenaries, they 
have greater loyalty to their Lord than do 
common soldiers. In return, they expect bet- 
ter treatment and more pay than the com- 
mon soldier receives. Although the elite unit 
can be chosen randomly, it is better to ask 
your DM what unit your fighter attracts. 
This allows him to choose a troop consistent 
with the campaign.

A fighter can hold property, including a

known that he attracts the loyalty of other

Paladin 


Ability Requirements: Strength 12 
Constitution 9 


Wisdom 13 

Charisma 17 
Prime Requisites: Strength, 

Charisma 
Races Allowed: Human 


The paladin is a noble and heroic war- 
rior, the symbol of all that is right and 
true in the world. As such, he has high 
ideals that he must maintain at all times. 
Throughout legend and history there are 
many heroes who could be called pala- 
dins: Roland and the 12 Peers of Charle- 
magne, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, and Sir 
Galahad are all examples of the class. 
However, many brave and heroic sol- 
diers have tried and failed to live up to 
the ideals of the paladin. It is not an easy 
task! 


Only a human may become a paladin. He 
must have minimum ability scores of 
Strength 12, Constitution 9, Wisdom 13, 
and Charisma 17. Strength and Charisma 
are the prime requisites of the paladin. A 
paladin must be lawful good in alignment 
and must always remain lawful good. A 
paladin who changes alignment, either 
deliberately or inadvertently, loses all his 
special powers—sometimes only temporari- 
ly and sometimes forever. He can use any 
weapon and wear any type of armor. 

A paladin who has Strength and Cha- 
risma scores of 16 or more gains a 10 percent 
bonus to the experience points he earns. 

Lawfulness and good deeds are the meat 
and drink of a paladin. If a paladin ever 
knowingly performs a chaotic act, he must 
seek a high-level (7th or more) cleric of Jaw- 
ful good alignment, confess his sin, and do 


27 


penance as prescribed by the cleric. If a pal- 
adin should ever knowingly and willingly 
perform an evil act, he loses the status of 
paladinhood immediately and irrevocably. 
All benefits are then lost and no deed or 
magic can restore the character to pala- 
dinhood: He is ever after a fighter. The 
character's level remains unchanged when 
this occurs and experience points are adjust- 
ed accordingly. Thereafter the character is 
bound by the rules for fighters. He does not 
gain the benefits of weapon specialization (if 
this is used) since he did not select this for 
his character at the start. 

If the paladin commits an evil act while 
enchanted or controlled by magic, he loses 
his paladin status until he can atone for the 
deed. This loss of status means the character 
loses all his special abilities and essentially 
functions as a fighter (without weapon spe- 
cialization) of the same level. Regaining his 
status undoubtedly requires completion of 
some dangerous quest or important mission 
to once again prove his worth and assuage 
his own guilt. He gains no experience prior 
to or during the course of this mission, and 
regains his standing as a paladin only upon 
completing the quest. 


A paladin has the following special bene- 
fits: 

A paladin can detect the presence of evil 
intent up to 60 feet away by concentrating 
on locating evil in a particular direction. He 
can do this as often as desired, but each 
attempt takes one round. This ability 
detects evil monsters and characters. 

A paladin receives a +2 bonus to all sav- 
ing throws. 

A paladin is immune to all forms of dis- 
ease. (Note that certain magical afflic- 
tions—lycanthropy and mummy rot—are 
curses and not diseases.) 

A paladin can heal by laying on hands. 
The paladin restores 2 hit points per experi- 
ence level. He can heal himself or someone 
else, but only once per day. 

A paladin can cure diseases of all sorts 
(though not cursed afflictions such as lycan- 
thropy). This can be done only once per 
week for each five levels of experience (once 
per week at levels 1 through 5, twice per 
week at levels 6 through 10, etc.). 

A paladin is surrounded by an aura of 
protection with a 10-foot radius. Within 
this radius, all summoned and specifically 
evil creatures suffer a —1 penalty to their 
attack rolls, regardless of whom they 
attack. Creatures affected by this aura can 
spot its source easily, even if the paladin is 
disguised. 

A paladin using a holy sword projects a 
circle of power 30 feet in diameter when the 
sword is unsheathed and held. This power 
dispels hostile magic of a level up to the pal- 
adin’s experience level. (A holy sword is a 
very special weapon; if your paladin 


Classes (Ranger) 


acquires one, the DM will explain its other 
powers.) 

A paladin gains the power to turn 
undead, devils, and demons when he reach- 
es 3rd level. He affects these monsters the 
same as does a cleric two levels lower—e.g., 
at 3rd level he has the turning power of a 
1st-level cleric. See the section on priests for 
more details on this ability. 

A paladin may call for his war horse upon 
reaching 4th level, or anytime thereafter. 
This faithful steed need not be a horse; it 
may be whatever sort of creature is appro- 
priate to the character (as decided by the 
DM). A paladin’s war horse is a very special 
animal, bonded by fate to the warrior. The 
paladin does not really “call” the animal, 
nor does the horse instantly appear in front 
of him. Rather, the character must find his 
war horse in some memorable way, most 
frequently by a specific quest. 

A paladin can cast priest spells once he 
reaches 9th level. He can cast only spells of 
the combat, divination, healing, and pro- 
tective spheres. (Spheres are explained in 
the Priest section.) The acquisition and cast- 
ing of these spells abide by the rules given 
for priests. 

The spell progression and casting level are 
listed in Table 17. Unlike a priest, the pala- 
din does not gain extra spells for a high Wis- 
dom score. The paladin cannot cast spells 
from clerical or druidical scrolls nor can he 
use priest items unless they are allowed to 
the warrior group.

The following strictures apply to pala- 
dins. 

A paladin may not possess more than 10 
magical items. Furthermore, these may not 
exceed one suit of armor, one shield, four 
weapons (arrows and bolts are not count- 
ed), and four other magical items. 

A paladin never retains wealth. He may 
keep only enough treasure to support him- 
self in a modest manner, pay his henchmen, 
men-at-arms, and servitors a reasonable 
rate, and to construct or maintain a small 


castle or keep (funds can be set aside for this 
purpose). All excess must be donated to the 
church or another worthy cause. This 
money can never be given to another player 
character or NPC controlled by a player. 

A paladin must tithe to whatever charita- 
ble, religious institution of lawful good 
alignment he serves. A tithe is 10 percent of 
the paladin’‘s income, whether coins, jewels, 
magical items, wages, rewards, or taxes. It 
must be paid immediately. 

A paladin does not attract a body of fol- 
lowers upon reaching 9th level or building a 
castle. However, he can still hire soldiers 
and specialists, although these men must be 
lawful good in comportment. 

A paladin may employ only lawful good 
henchmen (or those who act in such a man- 
ner when alignment is unknown). A paladin 
will cooperate with characters of other 
alignments only as long as they behave 
themselves. He will try to show them the 
proper way to live through both word and 
deed. The paladin realizes that most people 
simply cannot maintain his high standards. 
Even thieves can be tolerated, provided they 
are not evil and are sincerely trying to 
reform. He will not abide the company of 
those who commit evil or unrighteous acts. 
Stealth in the cause of good is acceptable, 
though only as a last resort. 


Ranger 

Ability 

Requirements: Strength 13 
Dexterity 13 
Constitution 14 
Wisdom 14 

Prime Requisites: Strength, Dexterity, 
Wisdom 

Races Allowed: Human, Elf, Half-elf 


The ranger must have scores not less than 
13 in Strength, 14 in Constitution, 13 in 
Dexterity, and 14 in Wisdom. The prime 
requisites of the ranger are Strength, Dex- 
terity, and Wisdom. Rangers are always 
good, but they can be lawful, neutral, or 
chaotic. It is in the rangers heart to do good, 
but not always by the rules. 

A ranger who has Strength, Dexterity, 
and Wisdom scores of 16 or more gains a 10 
percent bonus to the experience points he 
earns. 

Although the ranger can use any weapon 
and wear any armor, several of his special 
abilities are usable only when he is wearing 
studded leather or lighter armor. 

Although he has the basic skills of a war- 
rior, the ranger also has several advantages. 
When wearing studded leather or lighter 
armor, a ranger can fight two-handed with 
no penalty to his attack rolls (see page 96). 
Obviously, the ranger cannot use a shield 
when fighting this way. A ranger can still 
fight with two weapons while wearing 
heavier armor than studded leather, but he 
suffers the standard attack roll penalties. 

The ranger is a skilled woodsman. Even if 
the optional proficiency rules are not used, 
the ranger has Tracking proficiency. If the 
proficiency rules are used in your campaign, 
the ranger knows Tracking without expend- 
ing any points. Furthermore, this skill

improves by +1 for every three levels the 
ranger has earned (3rd to Sth level, +1; 6th 
to 8th level, +2, etc.). While wearing stud- 
ded leather or lighter armor, the ranger can 
try to move silently and hide in shadows. 
His chance to succeed in natural surround- 
ings is given on Table 18 (modified by the 
ranger’s race and Dexterity, as given on Ta- 
bles 27 and 28 on page 39). When attempt- 
ing these actions in non-natural 
surroundings (a musty crypt or city streets) 
the chance of success is halved. Hiding in 
shadows and moving silently are not possi- 
ble in any armor heavier than studded 
leather—the armor is inflexible and makes 
too much noise. 

In their roles as protectors of good, rang- 
ers tend to focus their efforts against some 
particular creature, usually one that ma- 
rauds their homeland. Before advancing to 
2nd level, every ranger must select a species 
enemy. Typical enemies include giants, 
orcs, lizard men, trolls, or ghouls; your DM 
has final approval on the choice. Thereafter, 
whenever the ranger encounters that enemy, 
he gains a +4 bonus to his attack rolls. This 
enmity can be concealed only with great dif- 
ficulty, so the ranger suffers a — 4 penalty on 
all encounter reactions with creatures of the 
hated type. Furthermore, the ranger will ac- 
tively seek out this enemy in combat in pref- 
erence to all other foes unless someone else 
presents a much greater danger. 

Rangers are adept with both trained and 
untamed creatures, having a limited degree 
of animal empathy. If a ranger carefully ap- 
proaches or tends any natural animal, he 
can try to modify the animal's reactions. (A 
natural animal is one that can be found in 
the real world—a bear, snake, zebra, etc.) 

When dealing with domestic or non- 
hostile animals, a ranger can approach the 
animal and befriend it automatically, He 
can easily discern the qualities of the crea- 
ture (spotting the best horse in the corral or 
seeing that the runt of the litter actually has 
great promise). 

When dealing with a wild animal or an 
animal trained to attack, the animal must 
roll a saving throw vs. rods to resist the 
ranger's overtures. (This table is used even 
though the ranger’s power is non-magical.) 
The ranger imposes a —1 penalty on the die 
roll for every three experience levels he has 
earned (—1 at Ist to 3rd, —2 at 4th to 6th, 
etc.). If the creature fails the saving throw, 
its reaction can be shifted one category as 
the ranger chooses. Of course, the ranger 
must be at the front of the party and must 
approach the creature fearlessly. 

For example, Beornhelm, a 7th-level 
‘anger, is leading his friends through the 
woods. On entering a clearing, he spots a 
wungry black bear blocking the path on the 
ther side. Signaling his friends to wait, 
seornhelm approaches the beast, whisper- 
ng soothing words. The DM rolls a saving 


throw vs. rods for the bear, modified by —3 
for Beornhelm’s level. The bear's normal re- 
action is unfriendly, but Beornhelm’s pres- 
ence reduces this to neutral. The party waits 
patiently until the bear wanders off to seek 
its dinner elsewhere. 

Later, Beornhelm goes to the horse market 
to get a new mount. The dealer shows him a 
spirited horse, notorious for being vicious and 
stubborn. Beornhelm approaches it carefully, 
again speaking soothingly, and mounts the 
stallion with no difficulty. Ridden by 
Beornhelm, the horse is spirited but well- 
behaved. Approached by anyone else, the 
horse reverts to its old ways. 

A ranger can learn priest spells, but only 
those of the plant or animal spheres (see 
page 34), when he reaches 8th level (see Ta- 
ble 18). He gains and uses his spells accord- 
ing to the rules given for priests (see page 
32). He does not gain bonus spells for a high 
Wisdom score, nor is he ever able to use 
clerical scrolls or magical items unless spe- 
cifically noted otherwise. 

Rangers can build castles, forts, or 
strongholds, but do not gain any special fol- 
lowers by doing so. 

At 10th level, a ranger attracts 2d6 fol- 
lowers. These followers might be normal 
humans, but they are often animals or even 
stranger denizens of the land. Table 19 can 
be used to determine these, or your DM 
may assign specific followers.

Of course, your DM can assign particular 
creatures, either choosing from the list 
above or from any other source. He can also 
rule that certain creatures are not found in 
the region—it is highly unlikely that a tiger 
would come wandering through a territory 
similar to western Europe! 

These followers arrive over the course of 
several months. Often they are encountered 
during the ranger’s adventures (allowing 
you and your DM a chance to role-play the 
initial meeting). While the followers are au- 
tomatically loyal and friendly toward the 
ranger, their future behavior depends on the 
ranger's treatment of them. In all cases, the 
ranger does not gain any special method of 
communicating with his followers. He must 
either have some way of speaking to them 
or they simply mutely accompany him on 
his journeys. (“Yeah, this bear's been with 
me for years. Don't know why—he just 
seems to follow me around. I don't own him 
and can't tell him to do anything he don't 
want to do,” said the grizzled old woodsman 
sitting outside the tavern.) 

Of course, the ranger is not obligated to 
take on followers. If he prefers to remain in- 
dependent, he can release his followers at 
any time. They reluctantly depart, but 
stand ready to answer any call for aid he 
might put out at a later time. 

Like the paladin, the ranger has a code of 
behavior. 

A ranger must always retain his good 
alignment. If the ranger intentionally com- 
mits an evil act, he automatically loses his 
ranger status. Thereafter he is considered a 
fighter of the same level (if he has more ex- 
perience points than a fighter of his level, he 
loses all the excess experience points), His 
ranger status can never be regained. If the 
ranger involuntarily commits an evil act 
(perhaps in a situation of no choice), he can- 
not earn any more experience points until he 
has cleansed himself of that evil. This can be 
accomplished by correcting the wrongs he 
committed, revenging himself on the person 
who forced him to commit the act, or releas- 
ing those oppressed by evil. The ranger in- 
stinctively knows what things he must do to 
regain his status (i.e., the DM creates a spe- 
cial adventure for the character), 

Furthermore, rangers tend to be loners, 
men constantly on the move. They cannot 
have henchmen, hirelings, mercenaries, or 
even servants until they reach 8th level. 
While they can have any monetary amount 
of treasure, they cannot have more treasure 
than they can carry. Excess treasure must ei- 
ther be converted to a portable form or do- 
nated to a worthy institution (an NPC 
group, not a player character). 


Wizard 


The wizard group 
encompasses all spellcasters working in the 
various fields of magic—both those who spe- 
cialize in specific schools of magic and those 
who study a broad range of magical theories. 
Spending their lives in pursuit of arcane wis- 
dom, wizards have little time for physical 
endeavors. They tend to be poor fighters with 
little knowledge of weaponry. However, they 
command powerful and dangerous energies 
with a few simple gestures, rare components, 
and mystical words. 

Spells are the tools, weapons, and armor 
of the wizard. He is weak in a toe-to-toe 
fight, but when prepared he can strike down 
his foes at a distance, vanish in an instant, 
become a wholly different creature, or even 
invade the mind of an enemy and take con- 
trol of his thoughts and actions. No secrets 
are safe from a wizard and no fortress is 
secure. His quest for knowledge and power 
often leads him into realms where mortals 
were never meant to go. 

Wizards cannot wear any armor, for several 
reasons. Firstly, most spells require complicated 
gestures and odd posturings by the caster and 
armor restricts the wearer's ability to do these 
properly. Secondly, the wizard spent his youth 
(and will spend most of his life) learning arcane 
languages, poring through old books, and prac- 
ticing his spells. This leaves no time for learning 
other things (like how to wear armor properly 
and use it effectively). If the wizard had spent 
his time learning about armor, he would not 
have even the meager skills and powers he 
begins with. There are even unfounded theories 
that claim the materials in most armors disrupt 
the delicate fabric of a spell as it gathers energy; 
the two cannot exist side by side in harmony. 
While this idea is popular with the common 
people, true wizards know this is simply not 
true. If it were, how would they ever be able to 
cast spells requiring iron braziers or metal 
bowls? 

For similar reasons, wizards are severely 
restricted in the weapons they can use. They 
are limited to those that are easy to learn or are 
sometimes useful in their own research. 
Hence, a wizard can use a dagger or a staff, 
items that are traditionally useful in magical 
studies. Other weapons allowed are darts, 
knives, and slings (weapons that require little 
skill, little strength, or both). 

Wizards can use more magical items than 
any other characters. These include 
potions, rings, wands, rods, scrolls, and 
most miscellaneous magical items. A wizard 
can use a magical version of any weapon 
allowed to his class but cannot use magical 
armor, because no armor is allowed. 
Between their spells and magical items, 
however, wizards wield great power. 

Finally, all wizards (whether mages or spe- 
cialists) can create new magical items, ranging 
from simple scrolls a:.d potions to powerful 


staves and magic swords. Once he reaches 9th 
level, a wizard can pen magical scrolls and 
brew potions. He can construct more power- 
ful magical items only after he has learned the 
appropriate spells (or works with someone 
who knows them). Your DM should consult 
the Spell Research and Magical Items sections 
of the DMG for more information. 

No matter what school of magic the wiz- 
ard is involved in, Intelligence is his prime 
requisite (or one of several prime requi- 
sites), Characters must have an Intelligence 
score of at least 9 to qualify to be a wizard. 

All wizards use Table 20 to determine 
their advancement in level as they earn 
experience points. They also use Table 21 to 
determine the levels and numbers of spells 
they can cast at each experience level. 

All wizards gain one four-sided Hit Die 
(1d4) per level from 1st through 10th levels. 
After 10th level, wizards earn 1 hit point per 
level and they no longer gain additional hit 
point bonuses for high Constitution scores.

Learning and casting spells require long 
study, patience, and research. Once his 
adventuring life begins, a wizard is largely 
responsible for his own education; he no 
longer has a teacher looking over his shoul- 
der and telling him which spell to learn next. 
This freedom is not without its price, how- 
ever. It means that the wizard must find his 
own source for magical knowledge: 
libraries, guilds, or captured books and 
scrolls. 

Whenever a wizard discovers instructions 
for a spell he doesn’t know, he can try to 
read and understand the instructions. The 
player must roll percentile dice. If the result 
is equal to or less than the percentage chance 
to learn a new spell (listed on Table 4, page 
16), the character understands the spell

and how to cast it. He can enter the spell in 
his spell book (unless he has already learned 
the maximum number of spells allowed for 
that level). If this die roll is higher than the 
character's chance to learn the spell, he 
doesn’t understand the spell. Once a spell is 
learned, it cannot be unlearned. It remains 
part of that character's repertoire forever. 
Thus a character cannot choose to “forget” a 
spell so as to replace it with another. 

A wizard’s spell book can be a single 
book, a set of books, a bundle of scrolls, or 
anything else your DM allows. The spell 
book is the wizard’s diary, laboratory jour- 
nal, and encyclopedia, containing a record 
of everything he knows. Naturally, it is his 
most treasured possession; without it he is 
almost helpless. 


Classes (Mage) 


A spell book contains the complicated 
instructions for casting the spell—the spell’s 
‘recipe, so to speak. Merely reading these 
instructions aloud or trying to mimic the 
instructions does not enable one to cast the 
spell. Spells gather and shape mystical ener- 
gies; the procedures involved are very 
demanding, bizarre, and intricate. Before a 
wizard can actually cast a spell, he must 
memorize its arcane formula. This locks an 
energy pattern for that particular spell into 
his mind. Once he has the spell memorized, 
it remains in his memory until he uses the 
exact combination of gestures, words, and 
materials that triggers the release of this 
energy pattern. Upon casting, the energy of 
the spell is spent, wiped clean from the wiz- 
ard’s mind. The wizard cannot cast that 
spell again until he returns to his spell book 
and memorizes it again. 

Initially the wizard is able to retain only a 
few of these magical energies in his mind at 
one time. Furthermore, some spells are 
more demanding and complex than others; 
these are impossible for the inexperienced 
wizard to memorize. With experience, the 
wizard's talent expands. He can memorize 
more spells and more complex spells. Still, 
he never escapes his need to study; the wiz- 
ard must always return to his spell books to 
refresh his powers. 

Another important power of the wizard is 
his ability to research new spells and con- 
struct magical items. Both endeavors are 
difficult, time-consuming, costly, occasion- 
ally even perilous. Through research, a wiz- 
ard can create an entirely new spell, subject 
to the DM's approval. Likewise, by consult- 
ing with your DM, your character can build 
magical items, either similar to those 
already given in the rules or of your own 
design. Your DM has information concern- 
ing spell research and magical item creation. 

Unlike many other characters, wizards gain 
no special benefits from building a fortress or 
stronghold. They can own property and 
receive the normal benefits, such as monthly 
income and mercenaries for protection. How- 
ever, the reputations of wizards tend to dis- 
courage people from flocking to their doors. 
At best, a wizard may acquire a few hench- 
men and apprentices to help in his work. 


Mage 

Ability Requirements: _ Intelligence 9 

Prime Requisite: Intelligence 

Races Allowed: Human, EIf, 
Half-elf 


Mages are the most versatile types of wiz- 
ards, those who choose not to specialize in 
any single school of magic. This is both an 
advantage and a disadvantage. On the posi- 
tive side, the mage’s selection of spells 
enables him to deal with many different sit- 
uations. (Wizards who study within a single 


school of magic learn highly specialized 
spells, but at the expense of spells from oth- 
er areas.) The other side of the coin is that 
the mage’s ability to learn specialized spells 
is limited compared to the specialist's. 


Mages have no historical counterparts; 
they exist only in legend and myth. 
However, players can model their char- 
acters after such legendary figures as 
Merlin, Circe, or Medea. Accounts of 
wizards and sorceresses are 
rare, since their reputations are based in 
no small part on the mystery that sur- 
rounds them. These legendary figures 
worked toward secret ends, seldom con- 
fiding in the normal folk around them. 


A mage who has an Intelligence score of 
16 or higher gains a 10 percent bonus to the 
experience points he earns. 


The Schools of Magic 


Spells are divided 
into nine different categories, or schools, 
according to the types of magical energy 
they utilize. Each school has its own special 
methods and practices. 

Although they are called schools, schools 
of magic are not organized places where a 
person goes to study. The word “school” 
identifies a magical discipline. A school is 
an approach to magic and spellcasting that 
emphasizes a particular sort of spell. Practi- 
tioners of a school of magic may set up a 
magical university to teach their methods to 
beginners, but this is not necessary. Many 
powerful wizards learned their craft study- 
ing under reclusive masters in distant lands. 

The nine schools of magic are Abjuration, 
Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning, En- 
chantment/Charm, Greater Divination, Illu- 
sion, Invocation/Evocation, Necromancy, 
and Lesser Divination.

This diagram illustrates the schools that 
oppose each other. See Table 22 and its entry 
descriptions for more information. 

Of these schools, eight are greater schools 
while the ninth, lesser divination, is a minor 
school. The minor school of lesser divina- 
tion includes all divination spells of the 4th 
spell level or less (available to all wizards). 
Greater divinations are those divination 
spells of the Sth spell level or higher. 


Specialist Wizards 
A wizard who concentrates his effort in a 


single school of magic is called a specialist. 
There are specialists in each type of magic, 
although some are extremely rare. Not all 
specialists are well-suited to adventuring— 
the diviner's spells are limited and not gener- 
ally useful in dangerous situations. On the 
other hand, player characters might want to 
consult an NPC diviner before starting an 
adventure. 

Specialist wizards have advantages and 
disadvantages when compared to mages. 
Their chance to know spells of their school 
of magic is greatly increased, but the inten- 
sive study results in a smaller chance to 
know spells outside their school. The num- 
ber of spells they can cast increases, but they 
lose the ability to cast spells of the school in 
opposition to their specialty (opposite it in 
the diagram). Their ability to research and 
create new spells within their specialty is 
increased, but the initial selection of spells 
in their school may be quite limited. All in 
all, players must consider the advantages 
and disadvantages carefully. 

Not all wizards can become specialists. 
The player character must meet certain 
requirements to become a specialist. Most 
specialist wizards must be single-classed; 
multi-classed characters cannot become 
specialists, except for gnomes, who seem to 
have more of a natural bent for the school of 
illusion than characters of any other race. 
Dual-class humans can choose to become 
specialists. The dedication to the particular 
school of magic requires all the attention 
and concentration of the character. He does 
not have time for other class-related pur- 
suits.

In addition, each school has different 
restrictions on race, ability scores, and 
schools of magic allowed. These restrictions 
are given on Table 22. Note that lesser divi- 
nation is not available as a specialty. The 
spells of this group, vital to the functioning 
of a wizard, are available to all wizards. 

Race lists those races that, either through 
a natural tendency or a quirk of fate, are 
allowed to specialize in that art. Note that 
the gnome, though unable to be a regular 
mage, can specialize in illusions. 

Minimum Ability score lists the ability 
minimums needed to study intensively in 
that school. All schools require at least the 
minimum Intelligence demanded of a mage 
and an additional prime requisite, as listed. 

Opposition School(s) always includes the 
school directly opposite the character's 
school of study in the diagram on page 31. 
In addition, the schools to either side of this 
one may also be disallowed due to the 
nature of the character's school. For exam- 
ple, an invoker/evoker cannot learn 
enchantment/charm or _ conjuration/ 
summoning spells and cannot use magical 
items that duplicate spells from these 
schools. 

Being a specialist does have significant 
advantages to balance the trade-offs the 
character must make. These are listed here: 

* A specialist gains one additional spell 
per spell level, provided the additional spell 
is taken in the specialist's school. Thus a Ist- 
level illusionist could have two spells—one 
being any spell he knows and the other lim- 
ited to spells of the illusion school. 

* Because specialists have an enhanced 
understanding of spells within their school, 
they receive a +1 bonus when making sav- 
ing throws against those spells when cast by 
other wizards. Likewise, other characters 
suffer a —1 penalty when making saving 
throws against a specialist casting spells 
within his school. Both of these modifiers 
can be in effect at the same time—e.g., when 
an enchanter casts an enchantment spell at 
another enchanter, the modifiers cancel 
each other out. 

* Specialists receive a bonus of +15 per- 
cent when learning spells from their school 
and a penalty of —15 percent when learning 
spells from other schools. The bonus or pen- 
alty is applied to the percentile dice roll the 
player must make when the character tries 
to learn a new spell (see Table 4). 

* Whenever a specialist reaches a new 
spell level, he automatically gains one spell 
of his school to add to his spell books. This 
spell can be selected by the DM or he can 
allow the player to pick. No roll for learning 
the spell need be made. It is assumed that the 
character has discovered this new spell dur- 
ing the course of his research and study. 

* When a specialist wizard attempts to 
create a new spell (using the rules given in 
the DMG), the DM should count the new 


spell as one level less (for determining the 
difficulty) if the spell falls within the school 
of the specialist. An enchanter attempting to 
create a new enchantment spell would have 
an easier time of it than an illusionist 
attempting to do the same. 


Illusionist 


Ability Requirements: Dexterity 16 
Prime Requisite: Intelligence 
Races Allowed: Human, Gnome 


The illusionist is an example of a special- 
ist. The description of the illusionist given 
here can be used as a guide for creating wiz- 
ards specializing in other magical schools. 

First, the school of illusion is a very 
demanding field of study. To specialize as an 
illusionist, a wizard needs a Dexterity score 
of at least 16. 

An illusionist who has an Intelligence of 
16 or more gains a 10 percent bonus to the 
experience points he earns. 

Because the illusionist knows far more 
about illusions than the standard wizard, he 
is allowed a +1 bonus when rolling saving 
throws against illusions; other characters 
suffer a —1 penalty when rolling saving 
throws against his illusions. (These modi- 
fiers apply only if the spell allows a saving 
throw.) 

Through the course of his studies, the illu- 
sionist has become adept at memorizing illu- 
sion spells (though it is still an arduous 
process). He can memorize an extra illusion 
spell at each spell level. Thus as a 1st-level 
caster he can memorize two spells, although 
at least one of these must be an illusion spell. 

Later, when he begins to research new 
spells for his collection, he finds it easier to 
devise new illusion spells to fill specialized 
needs. Research in other schools is harder 
and more time consuming for him. 

Finally, the intense study of illusion magic 
prevents the character from mastering the 
other classes of spells that are totally alien to 
the illusion school (those diametrically 
opposite illusion on the diagram). Thus, the 
illusionist cannot learn spells from the 
schools of necromancy, invocation/evo- 
cation, or abjuration. 

As an example, consider Joinville the illu- 
sionist. He has an Intelligence score of 15. In 
the course of his travels he captures an en- 
emy wizard’s spell book that contains an im- 
proved invisibility spell, a continual light 
spell, and a fireball spell, none of which are 
in Joinville’s spell book. He has an 80 per- 
cent chance to learn the improved invisibil- 
ity spell. Continual light is an alteration 
spell, however, so his chance to learn it is 
only 50 percent (consult Table 4 to see where 
these figures come from). He cannot learn 
the fireball spell, or even transcribe it into 
his spell book, because it is an evocation 
spell.

Priest 


The priest is a be- 
liever and advocate of a god from a particu- 
lar mythos. More than just a follower, he 
intercedes and acts on behalf of others, 
seeking to use his powers to advance the 
beliefs of his mythos. 

All priests have certain powers: The abil- 
ity to cast spells, the strength of arm to 
defend their beliefs, and special, deity- 
granted powers to aid them in their calling. 
While priests are not as fierce in combat as 
warriors, they are trained to use weaponry 
in the fight for their cause. They can cast 
spells, primarily to further their god’s aims 


Classes (Cleric) 


and protect its adherents. They have few of- 
fensive spells, but these are very powerful. 

All priests use eight-sided Hit Dice (d8s). 
Only priests gain additional spells for hav- 
ing high Wisdom scores. All priests have a 
limited selection of weapons and armor, but 
the restrictions vary according to the my- 
thos. 

All priests use Table 23 to determine their 
advancement in level as they gain experi- 
ence points. They also all use Table 24 to de- 
termine how many spells they receive at 
each level of experience. 

All priest spells are divided into 16 cate- 
gories called spheres of influence. Different 
types of priests have access to different 
spheres; no priest can cast spells from every 
sphere of influence. The 16 spheres of influ- 
ence are as follows: All, Animal, Astral, 
Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Ele- 
mental, Guardian, Healing, Necromantic, 
Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and 
Weather (see page 34). 

In addition, a priest has either major or 
minor access to a sphere. A priest with ma- 
jor access to a sphere can (eventually) cast 
all spells in the sphere. A priest with minor 
access to a sphere can cast only Ist-, 2nd-, 
and 3rd-level spells from that sphere. 

All priests gain one eight-sided Hit Die 
(1d8) per level from Ist through 9th. After 
9th level, priests earn 2 hit points per level 
and they no longer gain additional hit point 
bonuses for high Constitution scores.

Cleric 

Ability Requirement: Wisdom 9 
Prime Requisite: Wisdom 
Races Allowed: All 


The most common type of priest is the 
cleric. The cleric may be an adherent of any 
religion (though if the DM designs a specific 
mythos, the cleric’s abilities and spells may 
be changed—see following). Clerics are gen- 
erally good, but are not restricted to good; 
they can have any alignment acceptable to 
their order. A cleric must have a Wisdom 
score of 9 or more. High Constitution and 
Charisma are also particularly useful. 

A cleric who has a Wisdom of 16 or more 
gains a 10 percent bonus to the experience 
points he earns. 


The cleric class is similar to certain reli- 
gious orders of knighthood of the Middle 


orders 
combtend nilitely endaclghoes ait 
with a code of protection and service. 


frequently 
found on the outer edges of the Christian 
world, either on the fringe of the wilder- 
ness or in war-torn lands. Archbishop 
Turpin (of The Song of Roland) is an ex- 
ample of such a cleric. Similar orders can 
also be found in other lands, such as the 
sohei of Japan. 


33 


Clerics are sturdy soldiers, although their 
selection of weapons is limited. They can 
wear any type of armor and use any shield. 
Standard clerics, being reluctant to shed 
blood or spread violence, are allowed to use 
only blunt, bludgeoning weapons. They can 
use a fair number of magical items including 
clerical scrolls, most potions and rings, 
some wands and rods, staves, armor, 
shields, and magical versions of any weap- 
ons allowed by their order. 

Spells are the main tools of the cleric, 
however, helping him to serve, fortify, pro- 
tect, and revitalize those under his care. He 
has a wide variety of spells to choose from, 
suitable to many different purposes and 
needs. (A priest of a specific mythos proba- 
bly has a more restricted range of spells— 
see page 34.) A cleric has major access to 
every sphere of influence except the plant, 
animal, weather, and elemental spheres (he 
has minor access to the elemental sphere 
and cannot cast spells of the other three 
spheres). 

The cleric receives his spells as insight di- 
rectly from his deity (the deity does not need 
to make a personal appearance to grant the 
spells the cleric prays for), as a sign of and 
reward for his faith, so he must take care not 
to abuse his power lest it be taken away as 
punishment. 

The cleric is also granted power over 
undead—evil creatures that exist in a form 
of non-life, neither dead nor alive. The 
cleric is charged with defeating these mock- 
eries of life. His ability to turn undead (see 
page 103) enables him to drive away these 
creatures or destroy them utterly (though a 
cleric of evil alignment can bind the crea- 
tures to his will). Some of the more common 
undead creatures are ghosts, zombies, skele- 
tons, ghouls, and mummies. Vampires and 
liches (undead sorcerers) are two of the 
most powerful undead. 

As a cleric advances in level, he gains addi- 
tional spells, better combat skills, and a 
stronger turning ability. Upon reaching 8th 
level, the cleric automatically attracts a fanati- 
cally loyal group of believers, provided the 
character has established a place of worship of 
significant size. The cleric can build this place 
of worship at any time during his career, but 
he does not attract believers until he reaches 
8th level. These followers are normal war- 
tiors, Oth-level soldiers, ready to fight for the 
cleric’s cause, The cleric attracts 20 to 200 of 
these followers; they arrive over a period of 
several weeks, After the initial followers as- 
semble, no new followers trickle in to fill the 
ranks of those who have fallen in service. The 
DM decides the exact number and types of fol- 
lowers attracted by the cleric. The character 
can hire other troops as needed, but these are 
not as loyal as his followers. 

. At 9th level, the cleric may receive official 
approval to establish a religious stronghold, 
be it a fortified abbey or a secluded convent. 


Classes (Priests of Specific Mythoi) 


Obviously, the stronghold must contain all 
the trappings of a place of worship and must 
be dedicated to the service of the cleric’s 
cause. However, the construction cost of the 
stronghold is half the normal price, since the 
work has official sanction and much of the 
labor is donated. The cleric can hold prop- 
erty and build a stronghold anytime before 
reaching 9th level, but this is done without 
church sanction and does not receive the 
benefits described above. 


Priests of Specific Mythoi 


In the simplest ver- 
sion of the AD&D® game, clerics serve reli- 
gions that can be generally described as 
“good” or “evil.” Nothing more needs to be 
said about it; the game will play perfectly 
well at this level. However, a DM who has 
taken the time to create a detailed campaign 
world has often spent some of that time de- 
vising elaborate pantheons, either unique 
creations or adaptations from history or lit- 
erature. If the option is open (and only your 
DM can decide), you may want your char- 
acter to adhere to a particular mythos, tak- 
ing advantage of the detail and color your 
DM has provided. If your character follows 
a particular mythos, expect him to have 
abilities, spells, and restrictions different 
from the generic cleric. 

Priesthood in any mythos must be de- 
fined in five categories: requirements, 
weapons allowed, spells allowed, granted 
powers, and ethos. 


Requirements 

Before a character can become a priest of 
a particular mythos, certain requirements 
must be met. These usually involve mini- 
mum ability scores and mandatory align- 
ments. All priests, regardless of mythos, 
must have Wisdom scores of at least 9. Be- 
yond this, your DM can set other require- 
ments as needed. A god of battle, for 
example, should require strong, healthy 
priests (13 Str, 12 Con), One whose sphere is 
art and beauty should demand high Wis- 
dom and Charisma (16 or better). Most dei- 
ties demand a specific type of behavior from 
their followers, and this will dictate align- 
ment choices. 


Weapons Allowed 

Not all mythoi are opposed to the shed- 
ding of blood. Indeed, some require their 
priests to use swords, spears, or other spe- 
cific weapons. A war deity might allow his 
priests to fight with spears or swords. An 
agricultural deity might emphasize weapons 
derived from farm implements—sickles and 
bills, for example. A deity of peace and har- 
mony might grant only the simplest and 
least harmful weapons—perhaps only las- 
soes and nets. Given below are some sug- 
gested weapons, but many more are 


possible (the DM always has the final word 
in this matter). 


Deity Weapon 
Agriculture Bill, flail, sickle 


Blacksmith War hammer 

Death Sickle 

Disease Scourge, whip 

Earth Pick 

Healing Man-catcher, quarterstaff 

Hunt Bow and arrows, javelin, light 
lance, sling, spear 

Lightning _ Dart, javelin, spear 

Love Bow and arrows, 
man-catcher 

Nature Club, scimitar, sickle 

Oceans Harpoon, spear, trident 

Peace Quarterstaff 

Strength Hammer 

Thunder Club, mace, war hammer 

War Battle axe, mace, morning 
star, spear, sword 

Wind Blowgun, dart 


Of course there are many other reasons a 
deity might be associated with a particular 
weapon or group of weapons. These are of- 
ten cultural, reflecting the weapons used by 
the people of the area. There may be a par- 
ticular legend associated with the deity, ty- 
ing it to some powerful artifact weapon 
(Thor's hammer, for example). The DM has 
the final choice in all situations. 


Spells Allowed 

A priest of a particular mythos is allowed 
to cast spells from only a few, related 
spheres. The priest's deity will have major 
and minor accesses to certain spheres, and 
this determines the spells available to the 
priest. (Each deity’s access to spheres is de- 
termined by the DM as he creates the pan- 
theon of his world.) The 16 spheres of 
influence are defined in the following para- 
graphs. 

A priest whose deity grants major access 
to a sphere can choose from any spell within 
that sphere (provided he is high enough in 
level to cast it), while one allowed only mi- 
nor access to the sphere is limited to spells of 
3rd level or below in that sphere. The com- 
bination of major and minor accesses to 
spheres results in a wide variation in the 
spells available to priests who worship dif- 
ferent deities. 

All refers to spells usable by any priest, 
regardless of mythos. There are no Powers 
(deities) of the Sphere of All. This group in- 
cludes spells the priest needs to perform ba- 
sic functions. 

Animal spells are those that affect or alter 
creatures. It does not include spells that af- 
fect people. Deities of nature and husbandry 
typically operate in this sphere. 

Astral is a small sphere of spells that 
enable movement or communication be- 
tween the different planes of existence. The 


34 


masters of a plane or particularly meddle- 
some Powers often grant spells from this 
sphere. 

Charm spells are those that affect the atti- 
tudes and actions of people. Deities of love, 
beauty, trickery, and art often allow access 
to this sphere. 

Combat spells are those that can be used 
to directly attack or harm the enemies of the 
priest or his mythos. These are often 
granted by deities of war or death. 

Creation spells enable the priest to pro- 
duce something from nothing, often to ben- 
efit his followers. This sphere can fill many 
different roles, from a provider to a trick- 
ster. 

Divination enables the priest to learn the 
safest course of action in a particular situa- 
tion, find a hidden item, or recover long- 
forgotten information. Deities of wisdom 
and knowledge typically have access to this 
sphere. 

Elemental spells are all those that affect 
the four basic elements of creation—earth, 
air, fire, and water. Nature deities, elemen- 
tal deities, those representing or protecting 
various crafts, and the deities of sailors 
would all draw spells from this sphere. 

Guardian spells place magical sentries over 
an item or person. These spells are more active 
than protection spells because they create an 
actual guardian creature of some type. Pro- 
tective, healing, and trickster deities may all 
grant spells of this sphere. 

Healing spells are those that cure dis- 
eases, remove afflictions, or heal wounds. 
These spells cannot restore life or regrow 
lost limbs. Healing spells can be reversed to 
cause injury, but such use is restricted to evil 
priests. Protective and merciful deities are 
most likely to grant these spells, while na- 
ture deities may have lesser access to them. 

Necromantic spells restore to a creature 
some element of its life-force that has been 
totally destroyed. It might be life, a limb, or 
an experience level. These spells in reverse 
are powerfully destructive, and are used 
only by extremely evil priests. Deities of life 
or death are most likely to act in this sphere. 

Plant spells affect plants, ranging from 
simple agriculture (improving crops and the 
like) to communicating with plant-like crea- 
tures. Agricultural and nature Powers grant 
spells in this sphere. 

Protection spells create mystical shields 
to defend the priest or his charges from evil 
attacks. War and protective deities are most 
likely to use these, although one devoted to 
mercy and kindness might also bestow these 
spells. 

Summoning spells serve to call creatures 
from other places, or even other dimen- 
sions, to the service of the priest. Such serv- 
ice is often against the will of the creature, 
so casting these spells often involves great 
risk. Since creatures summoned often cause 


Classes (Druid) 


great harm and destruction, these spells are 
sometimes bestowed by war or death 
powers. 

Sun spells are those dealing in the basic 
powers of the solar universe—the purity of 
light and its counterpart darkness. Sun 
spells are very common with nature, agri- 
cultural, or life-giving powers. 

Weather spells enable the priest to manip- 
ulate the forces of weather. Such manipula- 
tion can be as simple as providing rain to 
parched fields, or as complex as unbridling 
the power of a raging tempest. Not surpris- 
ingly, these tend to be the province of nature 
and agricultural powers and appear in the 
repertoire of sea and ocean powers. 


Additional spheres can be created by 
your DM. The listed spheres are typical of 
the areas in which deities concentrate their 
interest and power. Spells outside the deity’s 
major and minor spheres of influence are 
not available to its priests. 

Furthermore, the priest can obtain his 
spells at a faster or slower pace than the nor- 
mal cleric. Should the character’s ethos 
place emphasis on self-reliance, the spell 
progression is slower. Those deities associ- 
ated with many amazing and wondrous 
events might grant more spells per level. Of 
course, your DM has final say on this, and 
he must balance the gain or loss of spells 
against the other powers, abilities, and re- 
strictions of the character. 


Granted Powers 

Another aspect of a specific mythos is the 
special powers available to its priests. The 
cleric’s granted power is the ability to turn 
undead. This ability, however, is not com- 
mon to all priests. Other deities grant 
powers in accordance with their spheres. If 
your DM is using a specific mythos, he must 
decide what power is granted to your priest. 
Some possible suggestions are given below. 

* Incite Berserker Rage, adding a +2 bo- 
nus to attack and damage rolls (War). 

* Soothing Word, able to remove fear and 
influence hostile reactions (Peace, Mercy, 
Healing). 

* Charm or Fascination, which could act 
as a suggestion spell (Love, Beauty, Art). 

* Inspire Fear, radiating an aura of fear 
similar to the fear spell (Death). 

These are only a few of the granted 
powers that might be available to a charac- 
ter. As with allowed weapons, much de- 
pends on the culture of the region and the 
tales and legends surrounding the Power 
and its priests. 


Ethos 

All priests must live by certain tenets and 
beliefs. These guide the priests’ behavior. 
Clerics generally try to avoid shedding 
blood and try to aid their community. A 
war deity may order its priests to be at the 


forefront of battles and to actively crusade 
against all enemies. A harvest deity may 
want its priests to be active in the fields. The 
ethos may also dictate what alignment the 
priest must be. The nature of the mythos 
helps define the strictures the priest must 
follow. 


Priest Titles 

Priests of differing mythoi often go by ti- 
tles and names other than priest. A priest of 
nature, for example (especially one based on 
Western European tradition) could be called 
a druid (see this page). Shamans and witch 
doctors are also possibilities. A little library 
research will turn up many more unique and 


colorful titles, a few of which are listed here: 


Abbess, Abbot, Ayatollah, Bonze, 
Brother, Dom, Eye of the Law, Friar, 
Guru, Hajji, Imam, Mendicant, Metro- 
politan, Mullah, Pardoner, Patriarch, 
Prelate, Prior, Qadi, Rector, Vicar, and 
Yogi 


Balancing It All 

When creating a priest of a specific my- 
thos, careful attention must be given to the 
balance of the character's different abilities. 
A priest strong in one area or having a wide 
range of choice must be appropriately weak- 
ened in another area so that he does not be- 
come too powerful compared to the other 
priests in the game. If a war deity allows a 
priest the use of all weapons and armor, the 
character should be limited in the spells al- 
lowed or powers granted. At the other ex- 
treme, a character who follows a deity of 
peace should have significant spells and 
granted powers to make up for his extremely 
limited or non-existent choice of weapons. A 
druid, for example, has more granted powers 
than a normal cleric to compensate for his 
limited armor and spell selection.

Human, Half-elf 


Prime Requisites: 
Races Allowed: 


35 


The druid is an example of a priest de- 
signed for a specific mythos. His powers 
and beliefs are different from those of the 
cleric. The druid is a priest of nature and 
guardian of the wilderness, be it forest, 
plains, or jungle. 


Requirements 

A druid must be human or half-elven. He 
must have a Wisdom score of at least 12 and 
a Charisma score of 15 or more. Both of 
these abilities are prime requisites. 


Weapons Allowed 

Unlike the cleric, the druid is allowed to 
use only “natural” armors—leather armor 
and wooden shields, including those with 
magical enhancements. All other armors are 
forbidden to him. His weapons are limited 
to club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar, 
sling, and staff. 


Spells Allowed 

Druids do not have the same range of 
spells as clerics. They have major access to 
the following spheres: all, animal, elemen- 
tal, healing, plant, and weather. They have 
minor access to the divination sphere. 
Druids can use all magical items normally 
allowed priests, except for those that are 
written (books and scrolls) and armor and 
weapons not normally allowed for druids. 


Granted Powers 

A druid makes most saving throws as a 
priest, but he gains a bonus of +2 to all sav- 
ing throws vs. fire or electrical attacks. 

All druids can speak a secret language in 
addition to any other tongues they know. 
(If the optional proficiency rules are used, 
this language does not use a proficiency 
slot.) The vocabulary of this druidic lan- 
guage is limited to dealing with nature and 
natural events. Druids jealously guard this 
language; it is the one infallible method they 
have of recognizing each another. 

Additional powers are granted as the 
druid reaches higher levels: 

° He can identify plants, animals, and 
pure water with perfect sig after he 
reaches 3rd level. 

* He can pass through overgrown areas 
(thick thorn bushes, tangled vines, briar 
patches, etc.) without leaving a trail and at 
his normal movement rate after he reaches 
3rd level. 

* He can learn the languages of woodland 
creatures. These include centaurs, dryads, 
elves, fauns, gnomes, dragons, giants, liz- 
ard men, manticores, nixies, pixies, sprites, 
and treants. The druid can add one lan- 
guage at 3rd level and one more every time 
he advances a level above 3rd. (If the op- 
tional proficiency rules are used, it is the 
druid’s choice whether or not to spend a 
proficiency slot on one or more of these lan- 
guages.) 


Classes (Druid) 


* He is immune to charm spells cast by 
woodland creatures (dryads, nixies, etc.) 
after he reaches 7th level. 

* He gains the ability to shapechange into 
a reptile, bird, or mammal up to three times 
per day after he reaches 7th level. Each ani- 
mal form (reptile, bird, or mammal) can be 
used only once per day. The size can vary 
from that of a bullfrog or small bird to as 
large as a black bear. Upon assuming a new 
form, the druid heals 10 to 60 percent (1d6 x 
10%) of all damage he has suffered (round 
fractions down). The druid can only assume 
the form of a normal (real world) animal in 
its normal proportions, but by doing so he 
takes on all of that creature's char- 
acteristics—its movement rate and abilities, 
its Armor Class, number of attacks, and 
damage per attack. 

Thus, a druid could change into a wren to 
fly across a river, transform into a black 
bear on the opposite side and attack the orcs 
gathered there, and finally change into a 
snake to escape into the bushes before more 
orcs arrive. 

The druid’s clothing and one item held in 
each hand also become part of the new 
body; these reappear when the druid 
resumes his normal shape. The items cannot 
be used while the druid is in animal form. 

*A druid cannot turn undead. 


Ethos 

As protectors of nature, druids are aloof 
from the complications of the temporal 
world. Their greatest concern is for the con- 
tinuation of the orderly and proper cycles of 
nature—birth, growth, death, and rebirth. 
Druids tend to view all things as cyclic and 
thus the battles of good and evil are only the 
rising and falling tides of time. Only when 
the cycle and balance are disrupted does the 
druid become concerned. Given this view of 
things, the druid must be neutral in align- 
ment, 

Druids are charged with protecting 
wilderness—in particular trees, wild plants, 
wild animals, and crops. By association, 
they are also responsible for their followers 
and their animals. Druids recognize that all 
creatures (including humans) need food, 
shelter, and protection from harm. Hunt- 
ing, farming, and cutting lumber for homes 
are logical and necessary parts of the natu- 
ral cycle. However, druids do not tolerate 
unnecessary destruction or exploitation of 
nature for profit. Druids often prefer subtle 
and devious methods of revenge against 
those who defile nature. It is well known 
that druids are both very unforgiving and 
very patient. 

Mistletoe is an important holy symbol to 
druids and it is a necessary part of some 
spells (those requiring a holy symbol). To be 
fully effective, the mistletoe must be gath- 
ered by the light of the full moon using a 
golden or silver sickle specially made for the 


purpose. Mistletoe gathered by other means 
halves the effectiveness of a given spell, if it 
causes damage or has an area of effect, and 
grants the target a +2 bonus to his saving 
throw if a saving throw is applicable. 
Druids as a class do not dwell perma- 
nently in castles, cities, or towns. All druids 
prefer to live in sacred groves, where they 
build small sod, log, or stone cottages. 


Druid Organization 

Druids have a worldwide structure. At 
their upper levels (12th and above), only a 
few druids can hold each level. 


Druids, Archdruids, and the Great Druid 

At 12th level, the druid character acquires 
the official title of “druid” (all druid charac- 
ters below 12th level are officially known as 
“initiates”). There can be only nine 12th- 
level druids in any geographic region (as 
defined by oceans, seas, and mountain 
ranges; a continent may consist of three or 
four such regions). A character cannot 
reach 12th level unless he takes his place as 
one of the nine druids. This is possible only 
if there are currently fewer than nine druids 
in the region, or if the character defeats one 
of the nine druids in magical or hand-to- 
hand combat, thereby assuming the defeat- 
ed druid’s position. If such combat is not 
mortal, the loser drops experience points so 
that he has exactly 200,000 remaining—just 
enough to be 11th level. 

The precise details of each combat are 
worked out between the two combatants in 
advance. The combat can be magical, non- 
magical, or a mixture of both. It can be 
fought to the death, until only one character 
is unconscious, until a predetermined num- 
ber of hit points is lost, or even until the first 
blow is landed, although in this case both 
players would have to be supremely confi- 
dent of their abilities. Whatever can be 
agreed upon between the characters is legiti- 
mate, so long as there is some element of 
skill and risk. 

When a character becomes a 12th-level 
druid, he gains three underlings. Their level 
depends on the character's position among 
the nine druids. The druid with the most 
experience points is served by three initiates 
of 9th level; the second-most experienced 
druid is served by three initiates of 8th level; 
and so on, until the least experienced druid 
is served by three Ist-level initiates. 

Only three archdruids (13th level) can 
operate in a geographical region. To become 
an archdruid, a 12th-level druid must defeat 
one of the reigning archdruids or advance 
into a vacant position. Each of the three 
archdruids is served by three initiates of 
10th level. From among the archdruids of 
the entire world, three are chosen to serve 
the Grand Druid (see “The Grand Druid and 
Hierophant Druids” section). These three 
retain their attendees but are themselves ser- 


37 


vants of the Grand Druid. 

The great druid (14th level) is unique in 
his region. He, too, won his position from 
the previous great druid. He is served by 
three initiates of 11th level. 

The ascendance of a new great druid usu- 
ally sets off shock waves of turmoil and cha- 
os through the druidical hierarchy. The 
advancement of an archdruid creates an 
opening that is fiercely contested by the 
druids, and the advancement of a druid cre- 
ates an opening in their ranks. 


The Grand Druid and Hierophant Druids 

The highest ranking druid in the world is 
the Grand Druid (15th level). Unlike great 
druids (several of whom can operate simul- 
taneously in different lands), only one per- 
son in a world can ever hold this title at one 
time. Consequently, only one druid can be 
15th level at any time. 

The Grand Druid knows six spells of each 
level (instead of the normal spell progres- 
sion) and also can cast up to six additional 
spell levels, either as a single spell or as sev- 
eral spells whose levels total to six (e.g., one 
6th-level spell, six 1st-level spells, three 2nd- 
level spells, etc.). 

The Grand Druid is attended by nine oth- 
er druids who are subject only to him and 
have nothing to do with the hierarchy of 
any specific land or area. Any druid charac- 
ter of any level can seek the Grand Druid 
and ask to serve him. Three of these nine are 
archdruids who roam the world, acting as 
his messengers and agents. Each of them 
receives four additional spell levels. The 
remainder are normally druids of 7th to 
11th level, although the Grand Druid can 
request a druid of any level to serve him and 
often considers applications from humble 
aspirants. 

The position of Grand Druid is not won 
through combat. Instead, the Grand Druid 
selects his successor from the acting great 
druids. The position is demanding, thank- 
less, and generally unexciting for anyone 
except a politician. After a few hundred 
thousand experience points of such stuff, 
any adventurer worthy of the name proba- 
bly is ready to move on to something else. 

For this reason, the Grand Druid reaches 
16th level after earning only 500,000 more 
experience points. After reaching 16th level, 
the Grand Druid can step down from his 
position at any time, provided he can find a 
suitable successor (another druid with 
3,000,000 experience points). 

Upon stepping down, the former Grand 
Druid must relinquish the six bonus spell 
levels and all of his experience points but 1 
(he keeps the rest of his abilities). He is now 
a 16th-level hierophant druid, and begins 
advancing anew (using the progression 
given in Table 23). The character may rise as 
high as 20th level as a hierophant druid 
(almost always through self training). 


Beyond 15th level, a druid never gains 
any new spells (ignore the Priest Spell Pro- 
gression table from this point on). Casting 
level continues to rise with experience. 
Rather than spells, spell-like powers are 
acquired. 

16th level: At 16th level, the hierophant 
druid gains four powers: 

* Immunity to all natural poisons. Natu- 
ral poisons are ingested or insinuated ani- 
mal or vegetable poisons, including monster 
poisons, but not mineral poisons or poison 
gas. 

* Vigorous health for a person of his age. 
The hierophant is no longer subject to the 
ability score adjustments for aging. 

* The ability to alter his appearance at 
will. Appearance alteration is accomplished 
in one round. A height and weight increase 
or decrease of 50 percent is possible, with an 
apparent age from childhood to extreme old 
age. Body and facial features can resemble 
any human or humanoid creature. This 
alteration is not magical, so it cannot be 
detected by any means short of true seeing. 

17th Level: The character gains the bio- 
logical ability to hibernate. His body func- 
tions slow to the point where the character 
may appear dead to a casual observer; aging 
ceases. The character is completely uncon- 
scious during hibernation. He awakens 
either at a preordained time (“I will hiber- 
nate for 20 days”) or when there is a signifi- 
cant change in his environment (the weather 
turns cold, someone hits him with a stick, 
etc.). 

A 17th-level hierophant druid can also 
enter the elemental plane of Earth at will. 
The transference takes one round to com- 
plete. This ability also provides the means 
to survive on that plane, move around, and 
return to the Prime Material plane at will. It 
does not confer similar abilities or immuni- 
ties on the Prime Material plane. 

18th level: The character gains the ability 
to enter and survive in the elemental plane 
of Fire. 

19th level: The character gains the ability 
to enter and survive in the elemental plane 
of Water. 

20th level: The character gains the ability 
to enter and survive in the elemental plane 
of Air. 


Rogue 

Rogues are people 
who feel that the world (and everyone in it) 
somehow owes them a living. They get by 
day by day, living in the highest style they 
can afford and doing as little work as possi- 
ble. The less they have to toil and struggle 
like everyone else (while maintaining a com- 
fortable standard of living), the better off 
they think they are. While this attitude is 
neither evil nor cruel, it does not foster a 
good reputation. Many a rogue has a ques- 


tionable past or a shady background he'd 
prefer was left uninvestigated. 

Rogues combine a few of the qualities of 
the other character classes. They are 
allowed to use a wide variety of magical 
items, weapons, and armor. 

Rogues have some special abilities that 
are unique to their group. All rogues tend to 
be adept at languages and thus have a per- 
centage chance to read strange writings they 
come across. All are skilled in climbing and 
clinging to small cracks and outcroppings— 
even more skilled than the hardy men of the 
mountains. They are alert and attentive, 
hearing things that others would miss. 
Finally, they are dextrous (and just a little 
bit light-fingered), able to perform tricks 
and filch small items with varying degrees 
of success. 

Rogues have a number of special abilities, 
such as picking pockets and detecting noise, 
for which they are given a percentage 
chance of success (this chance depends on 
the class, level, Dexterity score, and race of 
the rogue). When a rogue tries to use a spe- 
cial ability, a percentile dice roll determines 
whether the attempt succeeds or fails. If the 
dice roll is equal to or less than the special 
ability score, the attempt succeeds. Other- 
wise, it fails. (See this page and page 39 for 
more details.) 

All rogues use Table 25 to determine their 
advancement in levels as they gain experi- 
ence points. 

All rogues gain one six-sided Hit Die 
(1d6) per level from 1st through 10th. After 
10th level, rogues earn 2 hit points per level 
and no longer receive additional hit point 
bonuses for high Constitution scores,

Thief 


Ability Requirement: Dexterity 9 
Prime Requisite: Dexterity 
Races Allowed: All 


Thieves come in all sizes and shapes, 
ready to live off the fat of the land by the 
easiest means possible. In some ways they 
are the epitome of roguishness. 


The thief’s prime requisite is Dexterity; a 
character must have a minimum score of 9 
to qualify for the class. While high numbers 
in other scores (particularly Intelligence) are 
desirable, they are not necessary. The thief 
can have any alignment except lawful good. 
Many are at least partially neutral. 

A thief with a Dexterity score of 16 or 
more gains a 10 percent bonus to the experi- 
ence points he earns. 

Thieves have a limited selection of weap- 
ons. Most of their time is spent practicing 
thieving skills. The allowed weapons are 
club, dagger, dart, hand crossbow, knife, 
lasso, short bow, sling, broad sword, long 
sword, short sword, and staff. A thief can 
wear leather, studded leather, padded leath- 
er, or elven chain armor. When wearing any 
allowed armor other than leather, the thief’s 
abilities are penalized (see Table 29). 

To determine the initial value of each 
skill, start with the base scores listed on 
Table 26. To these base scores, add (or sub- 
tract) any appropriate modifiers for race, 
Dexterity, and armor worn (given on Tables 
27, 28, and 29, respectively). 

The scores arrived at in the preceding par- 
agraph do not reflect the effort a thief has 
spent honing his skills. To simulate this 
extra training, all thieves at 1st level receive 
60 discretionary percentage points that they 
can add to their base scores. No more than 
30 points can be assigned to any single skill. 
Other than this restriction, the player can 
distribute the points however he wants. 

Each time the thief rises a level in experi- 
ence, the player receives another 30 points 
to distribute. No more than 15 points per 
level can be assigned to a single skill, and no 
skill can be raised above 95 percent, includ- 
ing all adjustments for Dexterity, race, and 
armor. As an option, the DM can rule that 
some portion of the points earned must be 
applied to skills used during the course of 
the adventure. 


Table 26: THIEVING SKILL 


BASE SCORES 

Skill Base Score 
Pick Pockets 15% 
Open Locks 10% 
Find/Remove Traps 5% 
Move Silently 10% 
Hide in Shadows 5% 
Detect Noise 15% 
Climb Walls 60% 
Read Languages 0% 


In addition to the base percentages listed 
above, demihuman characters and charac- 
ters with high or low Dexterity scores have 
adjustments to their base numbers. Some 
characters may find that, after adjustments, 
they have negative scores. In this case, the 
character must spend points raising his skill 
percentage to at least 1% before he can use 
the skill. (Some races just aren't very good 
at certain things!) 

A thief character uses the “No Armor” 
column if wearing bracers of defense or a 
cloak without large or heavy protective 
clothing. 


Skill Explanations 

Pick Pockets: The thief uses this skill 
when filching small items from other peo- 
ples’ pockets, sleeves, girdles, packs, etc., 
when palming items (such as keys), and 
when performing simple sleight of hand. 

A failed attempt means the thief did not 
get an item, but it does not mean that his at- 
tempt was detected. To determine whether 
the victim noticed the thief’s indiscretion, 
subtract three times the victim’s level from 
100. If the thief's pick pockets roll was equal 
to or greater than this number, the attempt 
is detected. A Oth-level victim, for example, 
notices the attempt only if the roll was 00 
(100), while a 13th-level character notices 
the attempt on a dice roll of 61 or more. In 
some cases, the attempt may succeed and be 
noticed at the same time. 


If the DM wishes, he can rule that a thief 
of higher level than his victim is less 
likely to be caught pilfering. The chance 


that the victim notices the attempt can be 
modified by subtracting the victim's level 
from the thief’s level, and then adding 
this number to the percentage chance the

this number is increased by six to 79 (73 
+ 6 = 79). This option only applies if 
the thief is higher level than his victim. 


A thief can try to pick someone's pocket 
as many times as he wants. Neither failure 
nor success prevents additional attempts, 
but getting caught might! 

Open Locks: A thief can try to pick pad- 
locks, finesse combination locks (if they ex- 
ist), and solve puzzle locks (locks with 
sliding panels, hidden releases, and con- 
cealed keyholes). Picking a padlock requires 
tools. Using typical thief’s tools grants nor- 
mal chances for success. Using improvised 
tools (a bit of wire, a thin dirk, a stick, etc.) 
imposes a penalty on the character's chance 
for success. The DM sets the penalty based 
on the situation; penalties can range from 
—5 for an improvised but suitable tool, to 
-—60 for an awkward and unsuitable item 
(like a stick). The amount of time required 
to pick a lock is 1d10 rounds. A thief can try 
to pick a particular lock only once per expe- 
rience level. If the attempt fails, the lock is 
simply too difficult for the character until he 
learns more about picking locks (goes up a 
level). 

Find/Remove Traps; The thief is trained 
to find small traps and alarms. These in- 
clude poisoned needles, spring blades, 
deadly gases, and warning bells. This skill is 
not effective for finding deadfall ceilings, 
crushing walls, or other large, mechanical 
traps. 

To find the trap, the thief must be able to 
touch and inspect the trapped object. Nor- 
mally, the DM rolls the dice to determine 
whether the thief finds a trap. If the DM 
says, “You didn’t find any traps,” it’s up to 
the player to decide whether that means 
there are no traps or there are traps but the 
thief didn’t see them. If the thief finds a trap, 
he knows its general principle but not its ex- 
act nature. A thief can check an item for 
traps once per experience level. Searching 
for a trap takes 1d10 rounds. 

Once a trap is found, the thief can try to 
remove it or disarm it. This also requires 
1d10 rounds. If the dice roll indicates suc- 
cess, the trap is disarmed. If the dice roll 
indicates failure, the trap is beyond the 
thief's current skill. He can try disarming the 
trap again when he advances to the next ex- 
perience level. If the dice roll is 96-100, the 
thief accidentally triggers the trap and suf- 
fers the consequences. Sometimes (usually 
because his percentages are low) a thief will 
deliberately spring a trap rather than 


Classes (Thief) 


have unpleasant side effects if the trap 
doesn’t work quite the way the thief 
thought, and he triggers it while standing in 
the wrong place. 

This skill is far less useful when dealing 
with magical or invisible traps. Thieves can 
attempt to remove these traps, but their 
chances of success are half their normal per- 
centages. 

Move Silently: A thief can try to move si- 
lently at any time simply by announcing 
that he intends to do so. While moving si- 
lently, the thief’s movement rate is reduced 
to 1/3 normal. The DM rolls percentile dice 
to determine whether the thief is moving si- 
lently; the thief always thinks he is being 
quiet. Successful silent movement improves 
the thief’s chance to surprise a victim, avoid 
discovery, or move into position to stab an 
enemy in the back. Obviously, a thief mov- 
ing silently but in plain view of his enemies 
is wasting his time. 

Hide in Shadows: A thief can try to disap- 
pear into shadows or any other type of 
concealment—bushes, curtains, crannies, 
etc. A thief can hide this way only when no 
one is looking at him; he remains hidden 
only as long as he remains virtually motion- 
less. (The thief can make small, slow, care- 
ful movements: draw a weapon, uncork a 
potion, etc.) A thief can never become hid- 
den while a guard is watching him, no mat- 
ter what his dice roll is—his position is 
obvious to the guard. However, trying to 
hide from a creature that is locked in battle 
with another is possible, as the enemy’s at- 
tention is fixed elsewhere. The DM rolls the 
dice and keeps the result secret, but the thief 
always thinks he is hidden. 

Hiding in shadows cannot be done in to- 
tal darkness, since the talent lies in fooling 
the eye as much as in finding real conceal- 
ment (camouflage, as it were). However, 
hidden characters are equally concealed to 
those with or without infravision. Spells, 
magical items, and special abilities that re- 
veal invisible objects can reveal the location 
of a hidden thief. 

Detect Noise: A good thief pays attention 
to every detail, no matter how small, in- 
cluding faint sounds that most others miss. 
His ability to hear tiny sounds (behind 
heavy doors, down long hallways, etc.) is 
much better than the ordinary person's. Lis- 
tening is not automatic; the thief must stand 
still and concentrate on what he's hearing 
for one round. He must have silence in his 
immediate surroundings and must remove 
his helmet or hat. Sounds filtering through 
doors or other barriers are unclear at best. 

Climb Walls: Although everyone can 
climb rocky cliffs and steep slopes, the thief 
is far superior to others in this ability. Not 
only does he have a better climbing percent- 
age than other characters, he can also climb 
most surfaces without tools, ropes, or 


devices. Only the thief can climb smooth 
and very smooth surfaces without climbing 
gear. Of course, the thief is very limited in 
his actions while climbing—he is unable to 
fight or effectively defend himself. 

Read Languages: Out of necessity, 
thieves tend to learn odd bits of informa- 
tion. Among these is the ability to read vari- 
ous languages, particularly as they apply to 
treasure maps, deeds, secret notes, and the 
like. At 4th level, the thief has enough expo- 
sure to languages that he has a chance to 
read most nonmagical writing. This ability 
naturally improves with more experience. 
However, your DM can rule that some lan- 
guages (those the thief has never encoun- 
tered) are indecipherable to the thief. 

The die roll to read a language must be 
made every time the character tries to read 
a document (not just once per language). A 
successful die roll means the thief puzzled 
out the meaning of the writing. His under- 
standing of the document is roughly equal 
to his percentage chance for success: a 20 
percent chance means that, if the thief un- 
derstands it at all, he gets about 20 percent 
of the meaning. A different document in 
the same language requires another die roll 
(it probably contains different words). It 
isn't necessary to keep notes about what 
languages the thief has read in the past, 
since each document is handled individu- 
ally. 

Only one die roll can be made for any 
particular document at a given experience 
level. If the die roll fails, the thief can try 
again after gaining a new experience level. 


If the character knows how to read a 
given language because he spent a profi- 
ciency slot on it, this dice roll is unneces- 
sary for documents in that language. 


Thieves have other abilities not listed on 
Table 26: 

Backstab: Thieves are weak in toe-to-toe 
hacking matches, but they are masters of 
the knife in the back. When attacking some- 
one by surprise and from behind, a thief can 
improve his chance to successfully hit (+4 
modifier for rear attack and negate the tar- 
get's shield and Dexterity bonuses) and 
greatly increase the amount of damage his 
blow causes. 

To use this ability, the thief must be be- 
hind his victim and the victim must be un- 
aware that the thief intends to attack him. 
If an enemy sees the thief, hears him ap- 
proach from a blind side, or is warned by 
another, he is not caught unaware, and the 
backstab is handled like a normal attack 
(although bonuses for a rear attack still ap- 
ply). Opponents in battle will often notice 
a thief trying to maneuver behind them— 
the first rule of fighting is to never turn 
your back on an enemy! However, some- 


40 


one who isn’t expecting to be attacked (a 
friend or ally, perhaps) can be caught un- 
aware even if he knows the thief is behind 
him. 

The multiplier given in Table 30 applies to 
the amount of damage before modifiers for 
Strength or weapon bonuses are added. The 
weapon's standard damage is multiplied by 
the value given in Table 30. Then strength 
and magical weapon bonuses are added. 

Backstabbing does have limitations. 
First, the damage multiplier applies only to 
the first attack made by the thief, even if 
multiple attacks are possible. Once a blow is 
struck, the initial surprise effect is lost. Sec- 
ond, the thief cannot use it on every crea- 
ture. The victim must be generally 
humanoid. Part of the skill comes from 
knowing just where to strike. A thief could 
backstab an ogre, but he wouldn't be able to 
do the same to a beholder. The victim must 
also have a definable back (which leaves out 
most slimes, jellies, oozes, and the like). Fi- 
nally, the thief has to be able to reach a sig- 
nificant target area. To backstab a giant, the 
thief would have to be standing on a ledge 
or window balcony. Backstabbing him in 
the ankle just isn’t going to be as effective.

The ogre marches down the hallway, 
peering into the gloom ahead. He fails to no- 
tice the shadowy form of Ragnar the thief 
hidden in an alcove. Slipping into the hall- 
way, Ragnar creeps up behind the monster. 
As he sets himself to strike a mortal blow, 
his foot scrapes across the stone. The hairy 
ears of the ogre perk up. The beast whirls 
around, ruining Ragnar’s chance for a back- 
stab and what remains of his day. If Ragnar 
had made a successful roll to move silently, 
he could have attacked the ogre with a +4 
bonus on his chance to hit and inflicted five 
times his normal damage (since he is 15th 
level). 


Thieves’ Cant: Thieves’ cant is a special 
form of communication known by all 
thieves and their associates. It is not a dis- 
tinct language; it consists of slang words 
and implied meanings that can be worked 
into any language. The vocabulary of 
thieves’ cant limits its use to discussing 
things that interest thieves: stolen loot, 
easy marks, breaking and entering, mug- 
ging, confidence games, and the like. It is 
not a language, however. Two thieves can- 
not communicate via thieves’ cant unless 
they know a common language. The cant is 


useful, however, for identifying fellow cads 
and bounders by slipping a few tidbits of 
lingo into a normal conversation. 


The concept of thieves’ cant is historical 
(the cant probably is still used today in 
one form or another), although in the 
AD&D® game it has an ahistorically 
broad base. A few hours of research at a 
large library should turn up actual exam- 
ples of old thieves’ cant for those who 
want to learn more about the subject. 


Use Scrolls: At 10th level, a thief gains a 
limited ability to use magical and clerical 
scrolls. A thief's understanding of magical 
writings is far from complete, however. The 
thief has a 25 percent chance to read the 
scroll incorrectly and reverse the spell’s 
effect. This sort of malfunction is almost 
always detrimental to the thief and his par- 
ty. It could be as simple as accidentally cast- 
ing the reverse of the given spell or as 
complex as a foul-up on a fireball scroll, 
causing the ball of flame to be centered on 
the thief instead of its intended target. The 
exact effect is up to the DM (this is the sort 
of thing DMs enjoy, so expect the unexpect- 
ed). 

Thieves do not build castles or fortresses 
in the usual sense. Instead, they favor small, 
fortified dwellings, especially if the true pur- 
pose of the building can easily be disguised. 
A thief might, for example, construct a well- 
protected den in a large city behind the 
facade of a seedy tavern or old warehouse. 
Naturally, the true nature of the place will 
be a closely guarded secret! Thieves almost 
always build their strongholds in or near cit- 
ies, since that is where they ply their trades 
most lucratively. 

This, of course, assumes that the thief is 
interested in operating a band of thieves out 
of his stronghold. Not all thieves have larce- 
ny in their hearts, however. If a character 
devoted his life to those aspects of thieving 
that focus on scouting, stealth, and the intri- 
cacies of locks and traps, he could build an 
entirely different sort of stronghold—one 
filled with the unusual and intriguing 
objects he has collected during his adventur- 
ous life. Like any thief’s home, it should 
blend in with its surroundings; after all, a 
scout never advertises his whereabouts. It 
might be a formidable maze of rooms, secret 
passages, sliding panels, and mysterious 
paraphernalia from across the world. 

Once a thief reaches 10th level, his repu- 
tation is such that he can attract followers— 
either a gang of scoundrels and scalawags or 
a group of scouts eager to learn from a 
reputed master. The thief attracts 4d6 of 
these fellows. They are generally loyal to 
him, but a wise thief is always suspicious of 
his comrades. Table 31 can be used to deter- 
mine the type and level of followers, or the 


DM can choose followers appropriate to his 
campaign.

Thieves tend to be very jealous of their 
territory. If more than one thief starts a gang 
in the same area, the result is usually a war. 
The feud continues until one side or the oth- 
er is totally eliminated or forced to move its 
operation elsewhere. 


Bard 


Ability Requirements: Dexterity 12 
Intelligence 13 


Charisma 15 
Prime Requisite: Dexterity, Charisma 
Races Allowed: Human, Half-elf 


The bard is an optional character class 
that can be used if your DM allows. He 
makes his way in life by his charm, talent, 
and wit. A good bard should be glib of 
tongue, light of heart, and fleet of foot 
(when all else fails). 


In precise historical terms, the title 
“bard” applies only to certain groups of 
Celtic poets who sang the history of their 
tribes in long, recitative poems. These 
bards, found mainly in Ireland, Wales, 
and Scotland, filled many important 
roles in their society. They were store- 
houses of tribal history, reporters of 
news, messengers, and even 

dors to other tribes. However, in the 
AD&D® game, the bard is a more gener- 
alized character. Historical and legend- 
ary examples of the type include 
Alan-a-Dale, Will Scarlet, Amergin, and 
even Homer. Indeed, every culture has 
its storyteller or poet, whether he is 
called bard, skald, fili, jongleur, or 
something else. 


Ai 


To become a bard, a character must have 
a Dexterity of 12 or more, an Intelligence of 
13 or more, and a Charisma of 15 or more. 
The prime requisites are Dexterity and Cha- 
risma. A bard can be lawful, neutral or cha- 
otic, good or evil, but must always be 
partially neutral. Only by retaining some 
amount of detachment can he successfully 
fulfill his role as a bard. 

A bard, by his nature, tends to learn 
many different skills. He is a jack-of-all- 
trades but master of none. Although he 
fights as a rogue, he can use any weapon. He 
can wear any armor up to, and including, 
chain mail, but he cannot use a shield. 

All bards are proficient singers, chanters, 


Classes (Bard) 


or vocalists and can play a musical instru- 
ment of the player's choice (preferably one 
that is portable). Additional instruments 
can be learned if the optional proficiency 
rules are used—the bard can learn two in- 
struments for every proficiency slot spent. 

In his travels, a bard also manages to 
learn a few wizard spells. Like a wizard, a 
bard's Intelligence determines the number of 
spells he can know and the chance to know 
any given spell. These he keeps in his spell 
book, abiding by all the restrictions on 
memorization and spell use that bind a 
mage, especially in the prohibition of ar- 
mor. Hence, a bard will tend to use his spells 
more to entertain and impress than to fight. 
Table 32 lists the number of spells a bard can 
cast at each level. 

Since bards are dabblers rather than full- 
time wizards, their spells tend to be gained 
by serendipity and happenstance. In no case 
cana bard choose to specialize in a school of 
magic. Beginning bards do not have a selec- 
tion of spells. A 2nd-level bard begins with 
one to four spells, chosen either randomly 
or by the DM. (An Intelligence check must 
still be made to see if the bard can learn a 
given spell.) The bard is not guaranteed to 
know read magic, as this is not needed to 
read the writings in a spell book. The bard 
can add new spells to his spell book as he 
finds them, but he does not automatically 
gain additional spells as he advances in 
level. All spells beyond those he starts with 
must be found during the course of adven- 
turing. The bard's casting level is equal to 
his current level.

Combat and spells, however, are not the 
main strength of the bard. His expertise is in 
dealing and communicating with others. To 
this end, the bard has a number of special 
powers. The base percentage for each power 


is listed on Table 33. This base percentage 
must be adjusted for the race and Dexterity 
of the bard as given in the Thief description. 
After all adjustments are made, the player 
must distribute (however he chooses) 20 ad- 
ditional percentage points to the various 
special abilities. Thereafter, each time the 
character advances a level, he receives an 
additional 15 points to distribute. 


Table 33: BARD ABILITIES 


Climb _— Detect Pick Read 
Walls Noise Pockets Languages 
50% 20% 10% 5% 


Bard abilities are subject to modifiers for 
situation and armor as per the thief (see 
page 39 for a complete explanation). 

Climb Walls enables the bard to climb 
near sheer surfaces without the aid of tools, 
just like the thief. 

Detect Noise improves the bard's chances 
of hearing and interpreting sounds. He may 
be able to overhear parts of a conversation 
on the other side of a door or pick up the 
sound of something stalking the party. To 
use the ability, the bard must stand un- 
helmeted and concentrate for one round 
(one minute). During this time, all other 
party members must remain silent. The DM 
secretly makes the check and informs the 
player of the result. 

Pick Pockets enables the bard not only to 
filch small purses, wallets, keys, and the 
like, but also to perform small feats of 
sleight-of-hand (useful for entertaining a 
crowd). Complete details on pickpocketing 
(and your character's chances of getting 
caught) can be found in the Thief descrip- 
tion. 

Read Languages is an important ability, 
since words are the meat and drink of bards. 
They have some ability to read documents 
written in languages they do not know, re- 
lying on words and phrases they have 
picked up in their studies and travels. The 
Read Languages column in Table 33 gives 
the base percentage chance to puzzle out a 
foreign tongue. It also represents the degree 
of comprehension the bard has if he is suc- 
cessful. The DM can rule that a language is 
too rare or unfamiliar, especially if it has 
never been previously encountered by the 
bard, effectively foiling his attempts to 
translate it. At the other extreme, the bard 
need not make the dice roll for any language 
he is proficient in. Success is assumed to be 
automatic in such cases. 

The bard can also influence reactions of 
groups of NPCs. When performing before a 
group that is not attacking (and not intend- 
ing to attack in just seconds), the bard can 
try to alter the mood of the listeners, He can 
try to soften their mood or make it uglier. 
The method can be whatever is most suit- 
able to the situation at the moment—a fiery 
speech, collection of jokes, a sad tale, a fine 


42 


tune played on a fiddle, a haunting lute mel- 
ody, or a heroic song from the old home- 
land. Everyone in the group listening must 
roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation (if the 
crowd is large, make saving throws for 
groups of people using average hit dice). 
The die roll is modified by —1 for every 
three experience levels of the bard (round 
fractions down). If the saving throw fails, 
the group's reaction can be shifted one level 
(see the Reactions section in the DMG), to- 
ward either the friendly or hostile end of the 
scale, at the player's option. Those who 
make a successful saving throw have their 
reaction shifted one level toward the oppo- 
site end of the scale. 


Cwell the Fine has been captured by a 
group of bandits and hauled into their 
camp. Although they are not planning to 
kill him on the spot, any fool can plainly see 
that his future may be depressingly short. In 
desperation, Cwell begins spinning a comic 
tale about Duke Dunderhead and his blun- 
dering knights. It has always been a hit with 
the peasants, and he figures it's worth a try 
here. Most of the bandits have 1 Hit Die, but 
the few higher level leaders raise the average 
level to 3. Cwell is only 2nd level so he gains 
no modifier. A saving throw is rolled and 
the group fails (Cwell succeeds!), The ruffi- 
ans find his tale amusing. The player shifts 
their reaction from hostile to neutral. The 
bandits decide not to kill Cwell but to keep 
him around, under guard, to entertain 
them. If the bandits’ saving throw had suc- 
ceeded, the bandits would have been of- 
fended by the story (perhaps some of them 
served under Duke Dunderhead!), and their 
reaction would have shifted from hostile to 
violent. They probably would have roasted 
Cwell immediately. 


This ability cannot affect people in the 
midst of battle; it is effective only when the 
audience has time to listen. If Cwell tried 
telling his tale while the bandits were attack- 
ing his group, the bandits would have 
quickly decided that Cwell was a fool and 
carried on with their business. Furthermore, 
the form of entertainment used must be ap- 
propriate to the audience. Cwell might be 
able to calm (or enrage) a bear with music, 
but he won't have much luck telling jokes to 
orcs unless he speaks their language. 

The music, poetry, and stories of the bard 
can also be inspirational, rallying friends 
and allies, If the exact nature of an impend- 
ing threat is known, the bard can heroically 
inspire his companions (immortalizing them 
in word and song), granting a +1 bonus to 
attack rolls, or a +1 bonus to saving 
throws, or a +2 bonus to morale (particu- 
larly useful in large battles) to’ those in- 
volved in melee. The bard must spend at 
least three full rounds singing or reciting be- 
fore the battle begins. This affects those

within a range of 10 feet per experience level 
of the bard. 

The effect lasts one round per level. Once 
the effect wears off, it can’t be renewed if the 
recipients are still in battle. However, 
troops who have withdrawn from combat 
can be reinspired by the bard's words. A 
troop of soldiers, inspired by Cwell, could 
charge into battle. After fighting a fierce 
fight, they retreat and the enemy does not 
pursue. Cwell, seeing them crestfallen and 
dispirited, once again rouses their will to 
fight. Reinvigorated, they charge back into 
battle with renewed spirit. 

Bards are also able to counter the effects 
of songs and poetry used as magical at- 
tacks. Characters within 30 feet of the bard 
are immune to the attack as long as the bard 
sings a counter song (or recites a poem, 
etc.). While doing this, the bard can per- 
form no other action except a slow walk. 
Furthermore, if he is struck or fails a saving 
throw, his effort is ruined. Success is 
checked by having the bard make a saving 
throw vs. spell. Success blocks the attack, 
failure means the attack has its normal ef- 
fect (everyone affected rolls saving throws, 
normal damage is inflicted, etc.). The bard 
can use this ability once per encounter or 
battle. This power does not affect verbal 
spell components or command words; it is 
effective against spells that involve explana- 
tions, commands, or suggestions. 

Finally, bards learn a little bit of every- 
thing in their studies and travels. Thus all 
bards can read and write their native tongue 
(if a written language exists) and all know 
local history (without cost if the optional 
proficiency rules are used). Furthermore, 
bards have a 5 percent chance per experi- 
ence level to identify the general purpose 
and function of any magical item. The bard 
need not handle the item but must examine 
it closely. Even if successful, the exact func- 
tion of the item is not revealed, only its gen- 
eral nature. 

Since Cwell the Fine is 2nd level, he has a 
10 percent chance to know something about 
a magical sword +1. If he succeeds, he 
knows whether the sword is cursed and 
whether it has an alignment (“This sword 
was used by the evil warrior Lurdas. | 
wouldn't touch it if I were you!”). This ability 
does not enable him to identify the sword’s 
exact properties, only its history and back- 
ground. He has no idea of its bonuses or pen- 
alties or any special magical powers, except 
as can be inferred from the histories. 

Being something of a warrior, a bard can 
build a stronghold and attract followers 
upon reaching 9th level. The bard attracts 
10d6 Oth-level soldiers into his service. They 
arrive over a period of time, but they are not 
automatically replaced if lost in battle. Of 
course, a bard can build a stronghold any 
time, but no followers arrive until he 
reaches 9th level. 


Upon reaching 10th level, a bard can at- 
tempt to use magical devices of written 
nature—scrolls, books, etc. However, his 
understanding of magic is imperfect (al- 
though better than that of a thief), so there is 
a 15% chance that any written item he uses 
is read incorrectly. When this happens, the 
magical power works the opposite of what 
is intended, generally to the detriment of the 
bard or his friends. The DM will tell you 
what happens to your character, based on 
the situation and particular magical item. 
The result may be unpleasant, deadly, or 
embarrassing. (Deciding these things is part 
of the DM's fun!) 


Multi-Class and 
Dual-Class Characters 


A multi-class char- 
acter improves in two or more classes simul- 
taneously. His experience is divided equally 
between each class. The available class com- 
binations vary according to race. The char- 
acter can use the abilities of both classes at 
any time, with only a few restrictions. Only 
demihumans can be multi-class characters. 

A dual-class character is one who starts 
with a single class, advances to moderate 
level, and then changes to a second charac- 
ter class and starts over again. The charac- 
ter retains the benefits and abilities of the 
first class but never again earns experience 
for using them. There are some limitations 
on combining the abilities of the two classes 
but, as long as minimum ability and align- 
ment requirements are met, there are no re- 
strictions on the possible character class 
combinations. Only humans can be dual- 
class characters. 


Multi-Class Combinations 


All of the standard 
demihuman races are listed here, along with 
their allowable multi-class combinations. 
Note that the character class names (not 
group names) are used below.

As stated earlier in their description, spe- 
cialist wizards cannot be multi-class (gnome 
illusionists are the single exception to this 
rule). The required devotion to their single 
field prevents specialist wizards from apply- 
ing themselves to other classes. Priests of a 
specific mythos might be allowed as a multi- 
class option; this will depend on the nature 
of the mythos as determined by the DM. 


Multi-Class Benefits and Restrictions 


A multi-class char- 
acter always uses the most favorable com- 
bat value and the best saving throw from his 
different classes. 

The character's hit points are the average 
of all his Hit Dice rolls. When the character 
is first created, the player rolls hit points for 
each class separately, totals them up, then 
divides by the number of dice rolled (round 
fractions down), Any Constitution bonus is 
then added to the character's hit points. If 
one of the character's classes is fighter and 
he has a Constitution of 17 or 18, then he 
gains the +3 or +4 Constitution bonus 
available only to warriors (instead of the 
+2 maximum available to the other charac- 
ter classes). 

Later the character is likely to gain levels 
in different classes at different times. When 
this happens, roll the appropriate Hit Die 
and divide the result by the number of 
classes the character has (round fractions 
down, but a Hit Die never yields less than 1 
hit point). The character's Constitution bo- 
nus is split between his classes; thus a 
fighter/mage gets 1/2 of his Con bonus when 
he goes up a level as a fighter and the other 
1/2 of the Con bonus when he goes up a level 
as a mage. A fighter/mage/thief would get 
1/3 of his bonus when he goes up as a fighter, 
1/3 when he goes up as a mage, and the other 
1/3 when he goes up as a thief. 

If the optional proficiency system is used, 
the character starts with the largest number 
of proficiency slots of the different classes. 
Thereafter, he gains new proficiency slots at 
the fastest of the given rates. To determine 
the character's initial money, roll according 
to the most generous of the character's dif- 
ferent classes. 


Rupert's character, Morrison the Multi- 
Faceted, is a half-elf fighter/mage/thief. At 
Ist level, Morrison rolls three dice for hit 
points: 1d10 (fighter), 1d6 (thief), and 1d4 
(mage). The results are 6, 5, and 2. Their 
sum (13) is divided by three and rounded 
down to equal 4 (13/3 = 41/3 = 4). Morri- 
son begins the game with 4 hit points. Later, 
Morrison reaches 2nd level as a thief before 
he reaches 2nd level as a fighter or a mage. 
He rolls 1d6 for additional hit points and the 
result is 4. He divides this by 3 (because he 
has three classes) and rounds down. Morri- 
son gets 1 more hit point when he becomes a

2nd-level thief. (He will also roll 1d10 and 
1d4 [both rolls divided by 3] when he 
reaches 2nd level as a fighter and as a mage, 
respectively.) 


Multi-class characters can combine abili- 
ties from their different classes with the fol- 
lowing restrictions: 

Warrior: A multi-classed warrior can use 
all of his abilities without restriction. The 
warrior abilities form the base for other 
character classes. 

Priest: Regardless of his other classes, a 
multi-classed priest must abide by the 
weapon restrictions of his mythos. Thus, a 
fighter/cleric can use only bludgeoning 
weapons (but he uses the warrior combat 
value), He retains all his normal priest abili- 
ties. 

Wizard: A multi-classed wizard can 
freely combine the powers of the wizard 
with any other class allowed, although the 
wearing of armor is restricted. Elves wear- 
ing elven chain can cast spells in armor, as 
magic is part of the nature of elves. How- 
ever, elven chain is extremely rare and can 
never be purchased. It must be given, 
found, or won. 

Thief: A multi-classed thief cannot use 
any thieving abilities other than open locks 
or detect noise if he is wearing armor that is 
normally not allowed to thieves. He must 
remove his gauntlets to open locks and his 
helmet to detect noise. 


Dual-Class Benefits and Restrictions 


Only humans can 
be dual-classed characters. To be dual- 
classed, the character must have scores of 15 
or more in the prime requisites of his first 
class and scores of 17 or more in the prime 
requisites of any classes he switches to. The 
character selects one class to begin his ad- 
venturing life. He can advance in this class 
as many levels as he desires before switching 
to another class; there is no cut-off point be- 
yond which a character cannot switch. 
However, he must attain at least 2nd level in 
his current class before changing to another 
class. There is no limit to the number of 
classes a character can acquire, as long as he 
has the ability scores and wants to make the 
change. (Certain character classes have 
alignment restrictions that the character 
must meet, however.) 

Any time after reaching 2nd level, a hu- 
man character can enter a new character 
class, provided he has scores of 17 or better 
in the prime requisites of the new class. Af- 
ter switching to a new class, the character 
no longer earns experience points in his pre- 
vious character class and he can no longer 
advance in level in that class. Nor can he 
switch back to his first class at a later date, 
hoping to resume his advancement where he 
left off. Once he leaves a class he has fin- 


ished his studies in it. Instead, he starts over 
in a new class, at Ist level with 0 experience 
points, but he does retain his previous Hit 
Dice and hit points. He gains the abilities, 
and must abide by all of the restrictions, of 
the new class. He does not gain or lose any 
points on his ability scores (e.g., an 18 
Strength mage who changes to fighter does 
not gain the percentile Strength bonus, but 
likewise a fighter changing to a mage would 
not lose it). The character uses the combat 
and saving throw tables appropriate to his 
new class and level. 

This is not to imply that a dual-class hu- 
man forgets everything he knew before; he 
still has, at his fingertips, all the knowledge, 
abilities, and proficiencies of his old class. 
But if he uses any of his previous class’s abil- 
ities during an encounter, he earns no expe- 
rience for that encounter and only half 
experience for the adventure. The only val- 
ues that can be carried over from the pre- 
vious class without restriction are the 
character’s Hit Dice and hit points. The 
character is penalized for using his old at- 
tack or saving throw numbers, weapons or 
armor that are now prohibited, and any 
special abilities of the old class that are not 
also abilities of the new class. (The charac- 
ter is trying to learn new ways to do things; 
by slipping back to his old methods, he has 
set back his learning in his new character 
class.) 

In addition, the character earns no addi- 
tional Hit Dice or hit points while advanc- 
ing in his new class. 

The restrictions in the previous two para- 
graphs last until the character reaches a 
higher \evel in his new class than his maxi- 
mum level in any of his previous classes. At 
that point, both restrictions are dropped: 
the character gains the abilities of his pre- 
vious classes without jeopardizing his 
experience points for the adventure, and he 
earns additional Hit Dice (those of his new 
class) and hit points for gaining experience 
levels in his new class. 

Once these restrictions are lifted, the 
character must still abide by the restrictions 
of whichever class he is using at the mo- 
ment. A dual-class fighter/mage, for exam- 
ple, cannot cast spells while wearing armor. 


Tarus Blood-heart begins his career as a 
cleric with a Wisdom of 16. He rises to 3rd 
level and then decides to become a fighter, 
since his Strength is 17. He keeps his 14 hit 
points (rolled on 3d8), but in all other ways 
he is treated as a Ist-level fighter. Upon 
reaching 4th level, Tarus is allowed to roll 
1d10 for additional hit points. He can now 
cast spells as a 3rd-level cleric and fight as a 
4th-level fighter. For the rest of his career, 
Tarus advances as a fighter but retains his 
minor clerical powers—a useful advantage 
when the situation gets ugly! 


45 


When a dual-class or multi-class charac- 
ter is struck by a level-draining creature, he 
first loses levels in the class in which he has 
advanced the highest. When his different 
classes are equal in level, the class level re- 
quiring the most experience points is lost 
first. 

The player character is allowed to regain 
levels lost by level draining, but until he re- 
gains all of his former levels, he must select 
which class he will use prior to any particu- 
lar adventure. Using abilities of the other 
class then subjects him to the experience 
penalties given earlier. When he regains all 
of his former levels, he is then free to use all 
the abilities of all his classes once again. Of 
course, he cannot raise his earlier class(es) 
above the level(s) he was at when he 
switched class. 


Tarus is a 4th-level cleric/3rd-level 
fighter. He is struck by a wight and loses one 
level from his cleric class, since it is his high- 
est level. If struck again, he would lose one 
level from his fighter class. Thereafter he 
could regain his lost levels, but would have 
to choose to act as either a fighter or cleric. 
Once he earned enough experience to regain 
his previous fighter level, he would not be 
allowed to advance further in it (restoring 
himself to his previous level only). But he 
could still advance as a cleric and use his 
3rd-level fighter abilities. 


After all other steps toward creating a char- 
acter have been completed, the player must 
choose an alignment for the character. In 
some cases (especially the paladin), the 
choice of alignment may be limited. 

The character's alignment is a guide to his 
basic moral and ethical attitudes toward 
others, society, good, evil, and the forces of 
the universe in general. Use the chosen 
alignment as a guide to provide a clearer 
idea of how the character will handle moral 
dilemmas. Always consider alignment as a 
tool, not a straitjacket that restricts the 
character. Although alignment defines gen- 
eral attitudes, it certainly doesn’t prevent a 
character from changing his beliefs, acting 
irrationally, or behaving out of character. 

Alignment is divided into two sets of atti- 
tudes: order and chaos, and good and evil. 
By combining the different variations with- 
in the two sets, nine distinct alignments are 
created. These nine alignments serve well to 
define the attitudes of most of the people in 
the world. 


Law, Neutrality, 
and Chaos 


Attitudes toward 
order and chaos are divided into three 
opposing beliefs. Picture these beliefs as the 
points of a triangle, all pulling away from 
each other. The three beliefs are law, chaos, 
and neutrality. One of these represents each 
character's ethos—his understanding of 
society and relationships. 

Characters who believe in law maintain 
that order, organization, and society are 
important, indeed vital, forces of the uni- 
verse. The relationships between people and 
governments exist naturally. Lawful philos- 
ophers maintain that this order is not cre- 
ated by man but is a natural law of the 
universe. Although man does not create 
orderly structures, it is his obligation to 
function within them, lest the fabric of eve- 
rything crumble. For less philosophical 
types, lawfulness manifests itself in the 
belief that laws should be made and fol- 
lowed, if only to have understandable rules 
for society. People should not pursue per- 
sonal vendettas, for example, but should 
present their claims to the proper authori- 
ties. Strength comes through unity of 
action, as can be seen in guilds, empires, 
and powerful churches. 

Those espousing neutrality tend to take a 
more balanced view of things. They hold 
that for every force in the universe, there is 
an opposite force somewhere. Where there 
is lawfulness, there is also chaos; where 
there is neutrality, there is also partisanship. 
The same is true of good and evil, life and 
death. What is important is that all these 
forces remain in balance with each other. If 
one factor becomes ascendant over its oppo- 


Chapter 4: Alignment 


site, the universe becomes unbalanced. If 
enough of these polarities go out of balance, 
the fabric of reality could pull itself apart. 
For example, if death became ascendant 
over life, the universe would become a bar- 
ren wasteland. 

Philosophers of neutrality not only pre- 
suppose the existence of opposites, but they 
also theorize that the universe would vanish 
should one opposite completely destroy the 
other (since nothing can exist without its 
opposite). Fortunately for these philoso- 
phers (and all sentient life), the universe 
seems to be efficient at regulating itself. 
Only when a powerful, unbalancing force 
appears (which almost never happens) need 
the defenders of neutrality become seriously 
concerned. 

The believers in chaos hold that there is 
no preordained order or careful balance of 
forces in the universe. Instead they see the 
universe as a collection of things and events, 
some related to each other and others com- 
pletely independent. They tend to hold that 
individual actions account for the differ- 
ences in things and that events in one area 
do not alter the fabric of the universe half- 
way across the galaxy. Chaotic philoso- 
phers believe in the power of the individual 
over his own destiny and are fond of anar- 
chistic nations. Being more pragmatic, non- 
philosophers recognize the function of 
society in protecting their individual rights. 
Chaotics can be hard to govern as a group, 
since they place their own needs and desires 
above those of society. 


Good, Neutrality, and Evil 


Like law and order, 
the second set of attitudes is also divided 
into three parts. These parts describe, more 
or less, a character's moral outlook; they are 
his internal guideposts to what is right or 
wrong. 

Good characters are just that. They try to 
be honest, charitable, and forthright. Peo- 
ple are not perfect, however, so few are 
good all the time. There are always occa- 
sional failings and weaknesses, A good per- 
son, however, worries about his errors and 
normally tries to correct any damage done. 

Remember, however, that goodness has 
no absolute values. Although many things 
are commonly accepted as good (helping 
those in need, protecting the weak), differ- 
ent cultures impose their own interpreta- 
tions on what is good and what is evil. 

Those with a neutral moral stance often 
refrain from passing judgment on anything. 
They do not classify people, things, or 
events as good or evil; what is, is. In some 
cases, this is because the creature lacks the 
capacity to make a moral judgment (ani- 
mals fall into this category). Few normal 
creatures do anything for good or evil rea- 
sons. They kill because they are hungry or 


46 


threatened. They sleep where they find shel- 
ter. They do not worry about the moral con- 
sequences of their actions—their actions are 
instinctive. 

Evil is the antithesis of good and appears 
in many ways, some overt and others quite 
subtle. Only a few people of evil nature 
actively seek to cause harm or destruction. 
Most simply do not recognize that what 
they do is destructive or disruptive. People 
and things that obstruct the evil character's 
plans are mere hindrances that must be 
overcome. If someone is harmed in the pro- 
cess...well, that’s too bad. Remember that 
evil, like good, is interpreted differently in 
different societies. 


Alignment Combinations 
Nine different align- 
ments result from combining these two sets. 
Each alignment varies from all others, 
sometimes in broad, obvious ways, and 
sometimes in subtle ways. Each alignment is 
described in the following paragraphs. 

Lawful Good: Characters of this align- 
ment believe that an orderly, strong society 
with a well-organized government can work 
to make life better for the majority of the 
people. To ensure the quality of life, laws 
must be created and obeyed. When people 
respect the laws and try to help one another, 
society as a whole prospers. Therefore, law- 
ful good characters strive for those things 
that will bring the greatest benefit to the 
most people and cause the least harm. An 
honest and hard-working serf, a kindly and 
wise king, or a stern but forthright minister 
of justice are all examples of lawful good 
people. 

Lawful Neutral: Order and organization 
are of paramount importance to characters 
of this alignment. They believe in a strong, 
well-ordered government, whether that 
government is a tyranny or benevolent 
democracy. The benefits of organization 
and regimentation outweigh any moral 
questions raised by their actions. An inquis- 
itor determined to ferret out traitors at any 
cost or a soldier who never questions his 
orders are good examples of lawful neutral 
behavior. 

Lawful Evil: These characters believe in 
using society and its laws to benefit them- 
selves. Structure and organization elevate 
those who deserve to rule as well as provide 
a clearly defined hierarchy between master 
and servant. To this end, lawful evil charac- 
ters support laws and societies that protect 
their own concerns. If someone is hurt or 
suffers because of a law that benefits lawful 
evil characters, too bad. Lawful evil charac- 
ters obey laws out of fear of punishment. 
Because they may be forced to honor an 
unfavorable contract or oath they have 
made, lawful evil characters are usually 
very careful about giving their word. Once 


given, they break their word only if they 
can find a way to do it legally, within the 
laws of the society. An iron-fisted tyrant 
and a devious, greedy merchant are exam- 
ples of lawful evil beings. 

Neutral Good: These characters believe 
that a balance of forces is important, but 
that the concerns of law and chaos do not 
moderate the need for good. Since the uni- 
verse is vast and contains many creatures 
striving for different goals, a determined 
pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it 
may even maintain it. If fostering good 
means supporting organized society, then 
that is what must be done. If good can only 
come about through the overthrow of exist- 
ing social order, so be it. Social structure it- 
self has no innate value to them. A baron 
who violates the orders of his king to de- 
stroy something he sees as evil is an example 
of a neutral good character. 

True Neutral: True neutral characters be- 
lieve in the ultimate balance of forces, and 
they refuse to see actions as either good or 
evil. Since the majority of people in the 
world make judgments, true neutral charac- 
ters are extremely rare. True neutrals do 
their best to avoid siding with the forces of 
either good or evil, law or chaos. It is their 
duty to see that all of these forces remain in 
balanced contention. 

True neutral characters sometimes find 
themselves forced into rather peculiar alli- 
ances. To a great extent, they are compelled 
to side with the underdog in any given situa- 
tion, sometimes even changing sides as the 
previous loser becomes the winner. A true 
neutral druid might join the local barony to 
put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop 
out or switch sides when the gnolls were 
brought to the brink of destruction. He 
would seek to prevent either side from be- 
coming too powerful. Clearly, there are 
very few true neutral characters in the 
world. 

Neutral Evil: Neutral evil characters are 
primarily concerned with themselves and 
their own advancement. They have no par- 
ticular objection to working with others or, 
for that matter, going it on their own. Their 
only interest is in getting ahead. If there is a 
quick and easy way to gain a profit, 
whether it be legal, questionable, or obvi- 
ously illegal, they take advantage of it. Al- 
though neutral evil characters do not have 
the every-man-for-himself attitude of cha- 
otic characters, they have no qualms about 
betraying their friends and companions for 
personal gain. They typically base their alle- 
giance on power and money, which makes 
them quite receptive to bribes. An unscru- 
pulous mercenary, a common thief, and a 
double-crossing informer who betrays peo- 
ple to the authorities to protect and advance 
himself are typical examples of neutral evil 
characters. 


Chaotic Good: Chaotic good characters 
are strong individualists marked by a streak 
of kindness and benevolence. They believe 
in all the virtues of goodness and right, but 
they have little use for laws and regulations. 
They have no use for people who “try to 
push folk around and tell them what to do.” 
Their actions are guided by their own moral 
compass which, although good, may not al- 
ways be in perfect agreement with the rest of 
society. A brave frontiersman forever mov- 
ing on as settlers follow in his wake is an ex- 
ample of a chaotic good character. 

Chaotic Neutral: Chaotic neutral charac- 
ters believe that there is no order to any- 
thing, including their own actions. With this 
as a guiding principle, they tend to follow 
whatever whim strikes them at the moment. 
Good and evil are irrelevant when making a 
decision. Chaotic neutral characters are ex- 
tremely difficult to deal with. Such charac- 
ters have been known to cheerfully and for 
no apparent purpose gamble away every- 
thing they have on the roll of a single die. 
They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, 
the only reliable thing about them is that 
they cannot be relied upon! This alignment 
is perhaps the most difficult to play. Luna- 
tics and madmen tend toward chaotic neu- 
tral behavior. 

Chaotic Evil: These characters are the 
bane of all that is good and organized. Cha- 
otic evil characters are motivated by the de- 
sire for personal gain and pleasure. They see 
absolutely nothing wrong with taking what- 
ever they want by whatever means possible. 
Laws and governments are the tools of 
weaklings unable to fend for themselves. 
The strong have the right to take what they 
want, and the weak are there to be ex- 
ploited. When chaotic evil characters band 
together, they are not motivated by a desire 
to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful 
enemies. Such a group can be held together 
only by a strong leader capable of bullying 
his underlings into obedience. Since leader- 
ship is based on raw power, a leader is likely 
to be replaced at the first sign of weakness 
by anyone who can take his position away 
from him by any method. Bloodthirsty buc- 
caneers and monsters of low Intelligence are 
fine examples of chaotic evil personalities. 


Non-Aligned Creatures 


In addition to the 
alignments above, some things—par- 
ticularly unintelligent monsters (killer 
plants, etc.) and animals—never bother 
with moral and ethical concerns. For these 
creatures, alignment is simply not applica- 
ble. A dog, even a well-trained one, is nei- 
ther good nor evil, lawful nor chaotic. It is 
simply a dog. For these creatures, alignment 
is always detected as neutral.

Alignment (Playing Alignment) 


Playing the 
Character’s Alignment 


Aside from a few 
minimal restrictions required for some char- 
acter classes, a player is free to choose what- 
ever alignment he wants for his character. 
However, before rushing off and selecting 
an alignment, there are a few things to con- 
sider. 

First, alignment is an aid to role-playing 
and should be used that way. Don't choose 
an alignment that will be hard to role play 
or that won't be fun. A player who chooses 
an unappealing alignment probably will 
wind up playing a different alignment any- 
way. In that case, he might as well have cho- 
sen the second alignment to begin with. A 
player who thinks that lawful good charac- 
ters are boring goody-two-shoes who don’t 
get to have any fun should play a chaotic 
good character instead. On the other hand, 
a player who thinks that properly role- 
playing a heroic, lawful good fighter would 
be an interesting challenge is encouraged to 
try it. No one should be afraid to stretch his 
imagination. Remember, selecting an align- 
ment is a way of saying, “My character is 
going to act like a person who believes this.” 

Second, the game revolves around coop- 
eration among everyone in the group. The 
character who tries to go it alone or gets ev- 
eryone angry at him is likely to have a short 
career. Always consider the alignments of 
other characters in the group. Certain com- 
binations, particularly lawful good and any 
sort of evil, are explosive. Sooner or later 
the group will find itself spending more time 
arguing than adventuring. Some of this is 
unavoidable (and occasionally amusing), 
but too much is ultimately destructive. As 
the players argue, they get angry. As they 
get angry, their characters begin fighting 
among themselves. As the characters fight, 
the players continue to get more angry. 
Once anger and hostility take over a game, 
no one has fun. And what's the point of 
playing a game if the players don’t have 
fun? 

Third, some people choose to play evil 
alignments. Although there is no specific 
prohibition against this, there are several 
reasons why it is not a good idea. First, the 
AD&D® game is a game of heroic fantasy. 
What is heroic about being a villain? If an 
evilly aligned group plays its alignment cor- 
rectly, it is as much a battle for the charac- 
ters to work together as it is to take on the 
outside world. Neutral evil individuals 
would be paranoid (with some justification) 
that the others would betray them for profit 
or self-aggrandizement. Chaotic evil char- 
acters would try to get someone else to take 
all the risks so that they could become (or 
remain) strong and take over. Although 
lawful evil characters might have some code 


of conduct that governed their party, each 
member would look for ways to twist the 
rules to his own favor. A group of players 
who play a harmonious party of evil char- 
acters simply are not playing their align- 
ments correctly. By its nature, evil 
alignments call for disharmony and squab- 
bling, which destroys the fun. 

Imagine how groups of different align- 
ments might seek to divide a treasure trove. 
Suppose the adventuring party contains one 
character of each alignment (a virtually 
impossible situation, but useful for illustra- 
tion). Each is then allowed to present his 

ent: 

The lawful good character says, “Before 
we went on this adventure, we agreed to 
split the treasure equally, and that’s what 
we're going to do. First, we'll deduct the 
costs of the adventure and pay for the resur- 
rection of those who have fallen, since we're 
sharing all this equally. If someone can’t be 
raised, then his share goes to his family.” 

“Since we agreed to split equally, that’s 
fine," replies the lawful evil character 
thoughtfully. “But there was nothing in this 
deal about paying for anyone else's expens- 
es. It's not my fault if you spent a lot on 


Alignment (Playing Alignment) 


equipment! Furthermore, this deal applies 
only to the surviving partners; 1 don’t 
remember anything about dead partners. 
I'm not setting aside any money to raise that 
klutz. He’s someone else’s problem.” 

Flourishing a sheet of paper, the lawful 
neutral character breaks in. “It’s a good 
thing for you two that I've got things togeth- 
er, nice and organized. I had the foresight to 
write down the exact terms of our agree- 
ment, and we're all going to follow them.” 

The neutral good character balances the 
issues and decides, “I'm in favor of equal 
shares—that keeps everybody happy. I feel 
that expenses are each adventurer’s own 
business: If someone spent too much, then 
he should be more careful next time. But 
raising fallen comrades seems like a good 
idea, so I say we set aside money to do that.” 

After listening to the above arguments, 
the true neutral character decides not to say 
anything yet. He's not particularly con- 
cerned with any choice. If the issue can be 
solved without his becoming involved, 
great. But if it looks like one person is going 
to get everything, that’s when he'll step in 
and cast his vote for a more balanced distri- 
bution. 


, 


48 


The neutral evil character died during the 
adventure, so he doesn’t have anything to 
say. However, if he could make his opinion 
known, he would gladly argue that the 
group ought to pay for raising him and set 
aside a share for him. The neutral evil char- 
acter would also hope that the group doesn’t 
discover the big gem he secretly pocketed 
during one of the encounters. 

The chaotic good character objects to the 
whole business. “Look, it’s obvious that the 
original agreement is messed up. I say we 
scrap it and reward people for what they 
did. I saw some of you hiding in the back- 
ground when the rest of us were doing all 
the real fighting. I don’t see why anyone 
should be rewarded for being a coward! As 
far as raising dead partners, I say that's a 
matter of personal choice. I don’t mind 
chipping in for some of them, but I don't 
think I want everyone back in the group.” 

Outraged at the totally true but tactless 
accusation of cowardice, the chaotic evil 
character snaps back, “Look, I was doing an 
important job, guarding the rear! Can I help 
it if nothing tried to sneak up behind us? 
Now, it seems to me that all of you are 
pretty beat up—and I'm not. So, I don’t 
think there's going to be too much objection 
if I take all the jewelry and that wand. And 
I'll take anything interesting those two dead 
guys have. Now, you can either work with 
me and do what I say or get lost—per- 
manently!” 

The chaotic neutral character is also dead 
(after he tried to charge a gorgon), so he 
doesn’t contribute to the argument. How- 
ever, if he were alive, he would join forces 
with whichever side appealed to him the 
most at the moment. If he couldn't decide, 
he'd flip a coin. 

Clearly, widely diverse alignments in a 
group can make even the simplest task 
impossible. It is almost certain that the 
group in the example would come to blows 
before they could reach a decision. But 
dividing cash is not the only instance in 
which this group would have problems. 
Consider the battle in which they gained the 
treasure in the first place. 

Upon penetrating the heart of the ruined 
castle, the party met its foe, a powerful gor- 
gon commanded by a mad warrior. There, 
chained behind the two, was a helpless peas- 
ant kidnapped from a nearby village. 

The lawful good character unhesitatingly 
(but not foolishly) entered the battle; it was 
the right thing to do. He considered it his 
duty to protect the villagers. Besides, he 
could not abandon an innocent hostage to 
such fiends. He was willing to fight until he 
won or was dragged off by his friends. He 
had no intention of fighting to his own 
death, but he would not give up until he had 
tried his utmost to defeat the evil creatures. 

The lawful evil character also entered the 
battle willingly. Although he cared nothing 


for the peasant, he could not allow the two 
fiends to mock him. Still, there was no rea- 
son for him to risk all for one peasant. If 
forced to retreat, he could return with a 
stronger force, capture the criminals, and 
execute them publicly. If the peasant died in 
the meantime, their punishment would be 
that much more horrible. 

The lawful neutral character was willing 
to fight, because the villains threatened pub- 
lic order. However, he was not willing to 
risk his own life. He would have preferred 
to come back later with reinforcements. If 
the peasant could be saved, that is good, 
because he is part of the community. If not, 
it would be unfortunate but unavoidable. 

The neutral good character did not fight 
the gorgon or the warrior, but he tried to 
rescue the peasant. Saving the peasant was 
worthwhile, but there was no need to risk 
injury and death along the way. Thus, while 
the enemy was distracted in combat, he 
tried to slip past and free the peasant. 

The true neutral character weighed the 
situation carefully. Although it looked like 
the forces working for order would have the 
upper hand in the battle, he knew there had 
been a general trend toward chaos and 
destruction in the region that must be com- 
batted. He tried to help, but if the group 
failed, he could work to restore the balance 
of law and chaos elsewhere in the kingdom. 

The neutral evil character cared nothing 
about law, order, or the poor peasant. He 
figured that there had to be some treasure 
around somewhere. After all, the villain’s 
lair had once been a powerful temple. He 
could poke around for cash while the others 
did the real work. If the group got into real 
trouble and it looked like the villains would 
attack him, then he would fight. Unfortu- 
nately, a stray magical arrow killed him just 
after he found a large gem. 

The chaotic good character joined the 
fight for several reasons. Several people in 
the group were his friends, and he wanted to 
fight at their sides. Furthermore, the poor, 
kidnapped peasant deserved to be rescued. 
Thus, the chaotic good character fought to 
aid his companions and save the peasant. 
He didn’t care if the villains were killed, cap- 
tured, or just driven away. Their attacks 
against the village didn’t concern him. 

The chaotic neutral character decided to 
charge, screaming bloodthirsty cries, 
straight for the gorgon. Who knows? He 
might have broken its nerve and thrown it 
off guard. He discovered that his plan was a 
bad one when the gorgon’s breath killed 
him. 

The chaotic evil character saw no point in 
risking his hide for the villagers, the peas- 
ant, or the rest of the party. In fact, he 
thought of several good reasons not to. If 
the party was weakened, he might be able to 
take over. If the villains won, he could prob- 
ably make a deal with them and join their 


side. If everyone was killed, he could take 
everything he wanted and leave. All these 
sounded a lot better than getting hurt for lit- 
tle or no gain. So he stayed near the back of 
the battle, watching. If anyone asked, he 
could say he was watching the rear, making 
sure no one came to aid the enemy. 

The two preceding examples of alignment 
are extreme situations. It's not very likely 
that a player will ever play in a group of 
alignments as varied as those given here. If 
such a group ever does form, players should 
seriously reconsider the alignments of the 
different members of the party! More often, 
the adventuring party will consist of charac- 
ters with relatively compatible alignments. 
Even then, players who role-play their char- 
acters’ alignments will discover small issues 


of disagreement. 
Changing Alignment 


Alignment is a tool, 
not a straitjacket. It is possible for a player 
to change his character's alignment after the 
character is created, either by action or 
choice. However, changing alignment is not 
without its penalties. 

Most often the character's alignment will 
change because his actions are more in line 
with a different alignment. This can happen 
if the player is not paying attention to the 
character and his actions. The character 
gradually assumes a different alignment. 
For example, a lawful good fighter ignores 
the village council's plea for help because he 
wants to go fight evil elsewhere. This action 
is much closer to chaotic good, since the 
character is placing his desire over the need 
of the community. The fighter would find 
himself beginning to drift toward chaotic 
good alignment. 

All people have minor failings, however, 
so the character does not instantly become 
chaotic good. Several occasions of lax 
behavior are required before the character's 
alignment changes officially. During that 
time, extremely lawful good activities can 
swing the balance back. Although the play- 
er may have a good idea of where the char- 
acter’s alignment lies, only the DM knows 
for sure. 

Likewise, the character cannot wake up 
one morning and say, “I think I'll become 
lawful good today.” (Well, he can say it, but 
it won't have any effect.) A player can 
choose to change his character's alignment, 
but this change is accomplished by deeds, 
not words. Tell the DM of the intention and 
then try to play according to the new 
choice. 

Finally, there are many magical effects 
that can change a character's alignment. 
Rare and cursed magical items can instantly 
alter a character's alignment. Powerful arti- 
facts may slowly erode a character's deter- 
mination and willpower, causing subtle 


49 


Alignment (Changing Alignment) 


shifts in behavior. Spells can compel a char- 
acter to perform actions against his will. 
Although all of these have an effect, none 
are as permanent or damaging as those 
choices the character makes of his own free 
will, 

Changing the way a character behaves 
and thinks will cost him experience points 
and slow his advancement. Part of a charac- 
ter’s experience comes from learning how 
his own behavior affects him and the world 
around him. In real life, for example, a per- 
son learns that he doesn’t like horror movies 
only by going to see a few of them. Based on 
that experience, he learns to avoid certain 
types of movies. Changing behavior means 
discarding things the character learned pre- 
viously. Relearning things takes time. This 
costs the character experience. 

There are other, more immediate effects 
of changing alignment. Certain character 
classes require specific alignments. A pala- 
din who is no longer lawful good is no long- 
er a paladin, A character may have magical 
items usable only by specific alignments 
(intelligent swords, etc.). Such items don’t 
function (and may even prove dangerous) in 
the hands of a differently aligned character. 

News of a character's change in behavior 
will certainly get around to friends and 
acquaintances. Although some people he 
never considered friendly may now warm to 
him, others may take exception to his new 
attitudes. A few may even try to help him 
“see the error of his ways.” The local clergy, 
on whom he relies for healing, may look 
askance on his recent behavior, denying him 
their special services (while at the same time 
sermonizing on his plight). The character 
who changes alignment often finds himself 
unpopular, depending on the attitudes of 
the surrounding people. People do not 
understand him. If the character drifts into 
chaotic neutral behavior in a highly lawful 
city, the townspeople might decide that the 
character is afflicted and needs close super- 
vision, even confinement, for his own good! 

Ultimately, the player is advised to pick 
an alignment he can play comfortably, one 
that fits in with those of the rest of the 
group, and he should stay with that align- 
ment for the course of the character's career. 
There will be times when the DM, especially 
if he is clever, creates situations to test the 
character's resolve and ethics. But finding 
the right course of action within the charac- 
ters alignment is part of the fun and chal- 
lenge of role-playing. 


Chapter 5: Proficiencies (Optional 


Most of what a player character can do is 
defined by his race, class, and ability scores. 
These three characteristics don’t cover every- 
thing, however. Characters can have a wide 
range of talents, from the potent (and intri- 
cate) arts of magic to the simple and mundane 
knowledge of how to build a good fire. The 
character's magical ability (or lack thereof) is 
defined by his class. Lesser abilities, such as 
fire building, are defined by proficiencies. 

A proficiency is a learned skill that isn’t 
essential to the character's class. A ranger, for 
example, may find it useful to know some- 
thing about navigation, especially if he lives 
near an ocean or sea coast, On the other hand, 
he isn’t likely to suffer if he doesn’t know how 
to navigate; he is a ranger, not a sailor. 

Proficiencies are divided into two groups: 
weapon proficiencies (those related to weap- 
ons and combat) and nonweapon pro- 
ficiencies (those related to everything else). 

All proficiency rules are additions to the 
game. Weapon proficiencies are tournament- 
level rules, optional in regular play, and non- 
weapon proficiencies are completely optional. 
Proficiencies are not necessary for a balanced 
game. They add an additional dimension to 
characters, however, and anything that 
enriches characterization is a bonus. If weap- 
on proficiencies are used in your game, expect 
them to apply to all characters, including 
NPCs. Nonweapon proficiencies may be used 
by players who enjoy them and ignored by 
those who don’t without giving unfair advan- 
tages to anyone (provided your DM allows 
this; he's the one who must deal with any 
problems). 

Once a proficiency slot is filled, it can 
never be changed or reassigned. 


Acquiring Proficiencies 


Even newly cre- 
ated, Ist-level characters have proficiencies. 
The number of proficiency slots that a char- 
acter starts with is determined by his group, 
as shown in Table 34. Each proficiency slot 
is empty until the player “fills” it by select- 
ing a proficiency. If your DM allows non- 
weapon proficiencies, the character's 
Intelligence score can modify the number of 
slots he has, granting him more proficien- 
cies (see page 16). In both cases, new profi- 
ciencies are learned the same way. 

Consider the case of Rath, a dwarf fight- 
er. Table 34 gives him four weapon profi- 
ciency slots (he is a warrior). If nonweapon 
proficiencies are used, he has three slots and 
his Intelligence of 11 gives him two addi- 
tional proficiency slots (according to Table 
4, page 16) for a total of five nonweapon 
proficiency slots. The player must assign 
weapon or nonweapon proficiencies to all 
of these slots before the character goes on 
his first adventure. These represent what the 
character has learned before beginning his 
adventuring career. 


Table 34: PROFICIENCY SLOTS 


Weapon 
Proficiencies 
Group Initial #Levels 
Warrior oy 3 
Wizard 1 6 
Priest 2 4 
Rogue 2 4 


Thereafter, as the character advances in 
experience levels, he gains additional profi- 
ciency slots. The rate at which he gains them 
depends on the group he belongs to. Table 
34 lists how many weapon and nonweapon 
proficiency slots the character starts with, 
and how many levels the character must 
gain before he earns another slot. 

Initial Weapon Proficiencies is the num- 
ber of weapon proficiency slots received by 
characters of that group at 1st level. 

#Levels (for both weapon and non- 
weapon proficiencies) tells how quickly a 
character gains additional proficiency slots. 
A new proficiency slot is gained at every 
experience level that is evenly divisible by 
the number listed. Rath (a warrior), for 
example, gains one weapon proficiency slot 
at every level evenly divisible by 3. He gets 
one new slot at 3rd level, another at 6th, 
another at 9th, and so on. (Note that Rath 
also gains one nonweapon proficiency at 
3rd, 6th, 9th, etc.) 

Penalty is the modifier to the character's 
attack rolls when he fights using a weapon 
he is not proficient with. Rath, a dwarf, 
chose to be proficient with the warhammer. 
Finding himself in a desperate situation, he 
snatches up a flail, even though he knows 
little about it (he is not proficient with it). 
Using the weapon awkwardly, he has a —2 
penalty to his chance to hit. 

Initial Nonweapon Proficiencies is the 
number of nonweapon proficiency slots 
that character has at 1st level. Even if you 
are playing with weapon proficiencies, non- 
weapon proficiencies are optional. 


Training 


Like all skills and 
abilities, proficiencies do not leap unbidden 
and fully realized into a character's mind. 
Instead, a character must train, study, and 
practice to learn a new proficiency. How- 
ever, role-playing the training time needed 
to learn a new skill is not much fun. Thus 
there are no training times or study periods 
associated with any proficiency. When a 
character chooses a proficiency, it is 
assumed that he had been studying it in his 
spare time. 

Consider just how much spare time the 
character has. The player is not role-playing 
every second of his character's life. The 
player may decide to have his character 
spend a night in town before setting out

on the long journey the next day. Perhaps 
the character must wait around for several 
days while his companions heal from the 
last adventure. Or he might spend weeks on 
an uneventful ocean voyage. What is he 
doing during that time? 

Among other things, he is studying what- 
ever new proficiencies he will eventually 
learn. Using this “down time” to handle the 
unexciting aspects of a role-playing cam- 
paign lets players concentrate on more 
important (or more interesting) matters. 

Another part of training is finding a 
teacher. Most skills are easier to learn if 
someone teaches the character. The DM can 
handle this in several ways. For those who 
like simplicity, ignore the need for 
teachers—there are self-taught people eve- 
rywhere in the world. For those who want 
more complexity, make the player charac- 
ters find someone to teach them any new 
proficiency they want to learn. This can be 
another player character or an NPC. 
Although this adds realism, it tends to limit 
the PC's adventuring options, especially if 
he is required to stay in regular contact with 
his instructor. Furthermore, most teachers 
want payment. While a barter arrangement 
might be reached, the normal payment is 
cash. The actual cost of the service depends 
on the nature of the skill, the amount of 
training desired, the availability of tutors, 
the greed of the instructor, and the desire of 
the DM to remove excess cash from his cam- 


paign. 


Weapon Proficiencies 


A weapon profi- 
ciency measures a character's knowledge 
and training with a specific weapon. When 
a character is created, the player checks 
Table 34 to see how many weapon proficien- 
cy slots the character has. These initial slots 
must be filled immediately, before the char- 
acter embarks on his first adventure. Any 
slots that aren't filled by then are lost. 

Each weapon proficiency slot must be 
assigned to a particular weapon, not just a 
class of weapons. Each weapon listed in 
Table 44 (Weapons) requires its own profi- 
ciency; each has its own special tricks and 
quirks that must be mastered before the 
weapon can be handled properly and effec- 
tively. A fencer who is master of the epee, 
for example, is not necessarily skilled with a 
saber; the two weapons look similar, but the

has the weapon proficiency slots available. 
In one way, a weapon specialist is like a

fighting styles they are designed for are en- 
tirely different. A player character could be- 
come proficient with a long bow or a short 
bow, but not with all bows in general (unless 
he devotes a proficiency slot to each individ- 
ually). Furthermore, a character can assign 
weapon proficiency slots only to those weap- 
ons allowed to his character class. 

As a character reaches higher experience 
levels, he also earns additional weapon pro- 
ficiencies. The rate at which proficiencies 
are gained depends on the character's class. 
Warriors, who concentrate on their martial 
skills, learn to handle a great number of 
weapons. They gain weapon proficiencies 
quickly. Wizards, who spend their time 
studying forgotten magical arts, have little 
time to practice with weapons. They gain 
additional weapon proficiencies very 
slowly. Multi-class characters can use the 
most beneficial line on Table 34 to determine 
their initial proficiencies and when they gain 
new proficiencies. 


Effects of Weapon Proficiencies 


A character who 
has a specific weapon proficiency is skilled 
with that weapon and familiar with its use. 
A character does not gain any bonuses for 
using a weapon he is proficient with; the 
combat rules and attack chances assume 
that everyone uses a weapon he is proficient 
with. This eliminates the need to add a mod- 
ifier to every die roll during battle. 

When a character uses a weapon that he is 
not proficient with, however, he suffers a 
penalty on his chance to hit. The size of this 
penalty depends on the character's class. 
Warriors have the smallest penalty because 
they are assumed to have passing familiarity 
with all weapons. Wizards, by comparison, 
are heavily penalized because of their lim- 
ited study of weapons. The modifiers for 
each class (which are taken as penalties to 
the attack die roll) are listed on Table 34. 


Related Weapons Bonus 


When a character 
gains a weapon proficiency, he is learning to 
use a particular weapon effectively. How- 
ever, many weapons have similar character- 
istics. A long sword, bastard sword, and 
broad sword, while all different, are all 
heavy, slashing swords. A character who is 
trained with one can apply some of his skill 
to the others. He is not fully proficient with 


the weapon, but he knows more about it 
than someone who picks it up without any 
skill in similar weapons. 

When a character uses a weapon that is 
similar to a weapon he is proficient with, his 
attack penalty is only one-half the normal 
amount (rounded up). A warrior, for exam- 
ple, would have a —1 penalty with a related 
weapon instead of —2. A wizard would 
have a —3 penalty instead of —5. 

Specific decisions about which weapons 
are related are left to the DM. Some likely 
categories are: 


hand axe, battle axe; 

short bow, long bow, composite bow; 

heavy and light crossbows; 

dagger, knife; 

glaive, halberd, bardiche, voulge, 
guisarme, glaive-guisarme, guisarme- 
voulge; 

harpoon, spear, trident, javelin; 

footman’s mace, horseman’s mace, morn- 
ing star, flail, hammer, club; 

military fork, ranseur, spetum, partisan; 

scimitar, bastard sword, long sword, 
broad sword; 

sling, staff sling 


Weapon Specialization 


Knowing how to 
use a weapon without embarrassing your- 
self is very different from being a master of 
that weapon. There are warriors, and then 
there are martial artists. An Olympic fencer 
is more than just an athlete; he can do things 
with his weapon that astound most fencers. 

In the AD&D® game, part of your charac- 
ter’s skill is reflected in the bonuses he earns 
as he reaches higher levels. As your charac- 
ter advances, he becomes a wiser, more dan- 
gerous fighter. Experience has taught him to 
anticipate his opponents and to pounce on 
any advantage that presents itself. But this 
is a general, overall improvement, brought 
about by the warrior’s sharpening senses 
and timing. It applies equally to all types of 
fighting. 

Weapon specialization is an optional rule 
that enables a fighter (only) to choose a sin- 
gle weapon and specialize in its use. Any 
weapon may be chosen. Specialization is 
normally announced (and paid for with 
weapon proficiency slots) when the charac- 
ter is created. But even after a player charac- 
ter earns experience, he can still choose to 
specialize in a weapon, provided he 


52 


Cost of Specialization 

Weapon specialization is obtained by de- 
voting extra weapon proficiency slots to the 
chosen weapon. To specialize in any sort of 
melee weapon or crossbow, the character 
must devote two slots—one slot to become 
proficient with it, and then a second slot to 
specialize in it. Any bow (other than a cross- 
bow) requires a total of three proficiency 
slots: one for proficiency and two to spe- 
cialize. Assume, for the moment, that Rath 
the dwarf decided to specialize with the 
warhammer. Two of his four proficiency 
slots are thus devoted to the warhammer. 
With the two remaining, he can become 
proficient with the short sword and short 
bow (for example). 


Effects of Specialization 

When a character specializes with a melee 
weapon, he gains a +1 bonus to all his at- 
tack rolls with that weapon and a +2 bonus 
to all damage rolls (in addition to bonuses 
for Strength and magic). The attack bonuses 
are not magical and do not enable the char- 
acter to affect a creature that can be injured 
only by magical weapons. 

Bow and crossbow specialists gain an ad- 
ditional range category: point blank. 
Point-blank range for bows is from six feet 
to 30 feet. Point-blank range for crossbows 
is from six feet to 60 feet. At point-blank 
range, the character gains a +2 modifier on 
attack rolls. No additional damage is 
caused, but Strength (for bows) and magical 
bonuses apply. Furthermore, if the charac- 
ter has an arrow nocked and drawn, or a 
bolt loaded and cocked, and has his target in 
sight, he can fire at the beginning of the. 
round before any initiative rolls are made. 

Fighters who specialize also gain extra at- 
tacks earlier than those who don’t special- 
ize. Bonus attacks for specialists are listed 
on Table 35. The use of this table is ex- 
plained in Chapter 9: Combat. Bow special- 
ists do not gain any additional attacks per 
round, 


Nonweapon Proficiencies 


A player character 
is more than a collection of combat modi- 
fiers. Most people have a variety of skills 
learned over the years. Consider yourself as 
an example—how many skills do you pos- 
sess? If you have gone through 12 years of 
school, were moderately active in after- 
school programs, and did fairly well on 
your grades, the following might be a par- 


Proficiencies (Secondary Skills) 


tial list of your skills: 

English reading and writing 

Geometry, algebra, and trigonometry 

Basic chemistry 

Basic physics 

Music (playing an instrument, singing, or 
both) 

Spanish reading and writing (or French, 
German, etc.) 

Basic Shop or Home Economics 

Typing 

Driving 

History 

Basic biology 


In addition to the things learned in 
school, you have also learned things from 
your parents, friends, scouts, or other 
groups. You might be able to add any of the 
following to your list. 


Swimming 
Hunting 
Fishing 
Canoeing 
Sailing 
Horseback riding 
First aid 
Animal training 
Cooking 
Sewing 
Embroidery 
Dancing 


If you consider all your hobbies and all 
the things you have done, you probably 
know many more skills. In fact, if you make 
a list, you probably will be surprised by the 
large number of basic skills you have. And, 
at this point, you are (or were) still young! 

Now, having graduated from school, you 
get a job. Are you just a carpenter, mechan- 
ic, electrician, salesman, or secretary? Of 
course not; you are a lot more than just your 
job. All those things you learned in school 
and elsewhere are part of what you are. 
Shouldn't it be the same for your player 
character? 

For a really complete role-playing charac- 
ter, you should know what your character 
can do. There are three different ways to do 
this: using what you know, using second- 
ary skills, and using nonweapon proficien- 
cies. Each of these is optional, but each 
increases the amount of detail that rounds 
out your character. 


Using What You Know 


If your DM decides 
not to use secondary skills or nonweapon 
proficiencies, situations will arise in which 
you'll have to determine whether your char- 
acter has certain skills. For example, 
Delsenora the mage slips at the edge of a 
steep riverbank and tumbles into the water. 
The current sweeps her into the middle of 
the river. To escape, she must swim to 


safety. But does Delsenora know how to 
swim? 

One way to answer this is to pretend that 
your character knows most of the things 
that you know. Do you know how to swim? 
If you do, then your character can swim. If 
you know a little about mountain climbing, 
horseback riding, carpentry, or sewing, 
your character knows these things, too. 
This also applies to things your character 
might want to build. Perhaps your charac- 
ter decides he wants to build a catapult. If 
you can show your DM how to make such a 
device, then the DM may allow your char- 
acter the same knowledge. Indeed, you 
might visit the local library just to gain this 
information. 

There are real advantages to this method. 
You can learn something at the library or 
school and bring it into your game. Also, 
there are fewer rules to get in the way of 
your fun. Since there are fewer rules, your 
DM has a lot of flexibility and can play out 
all the drama inherent in a scene. 

There are also problems with this meth- 
od. First, you probably know a lot of things 
your character should not—basic electron- 
ics, the components of gunpowder, or calcu- 
lus, for instance. You have a lot of 
knowledge that is just not available to 
someone in a medieval world (even a fanta- 
sy medieval world). Likewise, there are 
things that a typical person in a medieval 
world would know that you, as a modern 
person, have never needed to learn. Do you 
know how to make armor? Skin a deer? Salt 
meat away for the winter? Turn flax into lin- 
en? Thatch a roof? Read heraldry? You 
might, but there is no way you can consider 
these common skills anymore. But in a 
medieval world they would be common, 

Also, knowing something about a skill or 
trade doesn’t mean you know a lot, and 
there is a big difference between the two. 
When Delsenora fell into the raging river, 
she had to swim out. But was she a strong 
enough swimmer to pull free of the current? 
The DM must make up a rule on the spot to 
handle the situation. Perhaps you can swim, 
but can you swim well enough to escape a 
raging torrent? 

The biggest drawback to this method is 
that there are no rules to resolve tricky situ- 
ations. The DM must make it up during 
play. Some players and DMs enjoy doing 
this. They think up good answers quickly. 
Many consider this to be a large part of the 
fun. This method is perfect for them, and 
they should use it. 

Other players and DMs like to have clear 
rules to prevent arguments. If this is the case 
in your group, it is better to use secondary 
skills or nonweapon proficiencies.

Secondary Skills 

The second method 
for determining what your character knows 
is to assign secondary skills. Secondary 
skills are broad areas of expertise. Most cor- 
respond to occupations that your character 
may have been apprenticed in or otherwise 
picked up before beginning his adventuring 
life. Secondary skills are much more general 
than nonweapon proficiencies. They should 
not be used in combination with non- 
weapon proficiencies, which are explained 
later. 

Every player character has a chance at a 
secondary skill. Either choose one from 
Table 36 or take a chance and roll randomly. 
A random roll may result in one, two, or no 
secondary skills.

Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiencies) 


Once a character has a secondary skill, it 
is up to the player and the DM to determine 
just what the character can do with it. The 
items in parentheses after each skill describe 
some of the things the character knows. 
Other knowledge may be added with the 
DM's approval. Thus, a hunter might know 
the basics of finding food in the wilderness, 
how to read animal signs to identify the 
types of creatures in the area, the habits of 
dangerous animals, and how to stalk wild 
animals. 

Like the previous method (“Using What 
You Know”), this method has strengths and 
weaknesses. Secondary skills do not pro- 
vide any rules for determining whether a 
character succeeds when he uses a skill to do 
something difficult. It is safe to assume that 
simple jobs succeed automatically. (A 
hunter could find food for himself without 
any difficulty.) For more complicated tasks, 
the DM must assign a chance for success. He 
can assign a percentage chance, have the 
character make a saving throw, or require 
an Ability check (see Glossary). The DM 
still has a lot of flexibility. 

This flexibility means the DM must some- 
times make up the rule to cover the situa- 
tion, however. As mentioned earlier, some 
DMs enjoy this; others do not, their 
strengths being elsewhere. While secondary 
skills define and limit the player's options, 
they do not greatly simplify the DM's job. 


Nonweapon Proficiencies 


The most detailed 
method for handling character skills is that 
of nonweapon proficiencies. These are 
much like weapon proficiencies. Each char- 
acter starts with a specific number of non- 
weapon proficiency slots and then earns 
additional slots as he advances. Initial slots 
must be assigned immediately; they cannot 
be saved or held in reserve. 

Nonweapon proficiencies are the most 
detailed way to handle the question of what 
the player character knows. They allow the 
player to choose from a broad selection and 
define the effects of each choice. Like the 
other methods, however, this system is not 
without drawbacks. First, nonweapon pro- 
ficiencies are rigid. Being so defined, they 
limit the options of both the player and DM. 
At the same time, there will still be ques- 
tions unanswered by these proficiencies. 
Whereas before such questions were broad, 
they will now tend to be more precise and 
detailed. Secondly, using this system 
increases the amount of time needed to cre- 
ate a character. While the end result is a 
more complete, well-rounded person, set- 
up time can take up to two or three hours. 
Novice players especially may be over- 
whelmed by the number of choices and 
rules. 

Unlike weapon proficiencies, in which 


some weapons are not available to certain 
character classes, all nonweapon proficien- 
cies are available to all characters. Some 
nonweapon proficiencies are easier for cer- 
tain character classes to learn, however. 
Table 37 lists all nonweapon proficien- 
cies. They are divided into categories that 
correspond to character groups. The profi- 
ciencies listed under each group can be 
learned easily by characters of that group. 
A fifth category—“General” —contains 


proficiencies that can be learned easily by 
any character. 

Refer to Table 38. When a player selects a 
nonweapon proficiency from those catego- 
ries listed under “Proficiency Groups” for 
his character's group, it requires the number 
of proficiency slots listed in Table 37. When 
a player selects a proficiency from any other 
category, it requires one additional profi- 
ciency slot beyond the number listed.

If a proficiency check is required, Table 37 
lists which ability is used with each profi- 
ciency. Add the modifier (either positive or 
negative) listed in Table 37 to the appropri- 
ate ability score. Then the player rolls 1d20. 
If the roll is equal to or less than the charac- 
ter's adjusted ability score, the character ac- 
complished what he was trying to do. If the 
roll is greater than the character's ability 
score, the character fails at the task. (A roll 
of 20 always fails.) The DM determines 
what effects, if any, accompany failure. 

Of course, to use a proficiency, the char- 
acter must have any tools and materials 
needed to do the job. A carpenter can do 
very little without his tools, and a smith is 
virtually helpless without a good forge. The 
character must also have enough time to do 
the job. Certainly, carpentry proficiency en- 
ables your character to build a house, but 
not in a single day! Some proficiency de- 
scriptions state how much time is required 
for certain jobs. Most, however, are left to 
the DM's judgment. 

The DM can raise or lower a character's 
chance of success if the situation calls for 
it. Factors that can affect a proficiency 
check include availability and quality of 
tools, quality of raw material used, time 
spent doing the job, difficulty of the job, 
and how familiar the character is with the 
task. A positive modifier is added to the 
ability score used for the check. A negative 
modifier is subtracted from the ability 
score. 

Rath, skilled as a blacksmith, has been 
making horseshoes for years. Because he is 
so familiar with the task and has every tool 
he needs, the DM lets him make horseshoes 
automatically, without risk of failure. How- 
ever, Delsenora has persuaded Rath to make 
an elaborate wrought-iron cage (she needs it 
to create a magical item). Rath has never 
done this before and the work is very intri- 
cate, so the DM imposes a penalty of —3 on 
Rath’s ability check. 

When two proficient characters work to- 
gether on the same task, the highest ability 
score is used (the one with the greatest 
chance of success). Furthermore, a +1 bo- 
nus is added for the other character's assist- 
ance. The bonus can never be more than 
+1, as having too many assistants is some- 
times worse than having none. 

Nonweapon proficiencies can also be im- 
proved beyond the ability score the charac- 
ter starts with. For every additional 
proficiency slot a character spends on a 
nonweapon proficiency, he gains a +1 bo- 
nus to those proficiency checks. Thus, Rath 
(were he not an adventurer) might spend his 
additional proficiency slots on blacksmith- 
ing, to become a very good blacksmith, 
gaining a +1, +2, +3, or greater bonus to 
his ability checks. 

Many non-player craftsmen are more ac- 
complished in their fields than player 


Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) 


characters, having devoted all their energies 
to improving a single proficiency. Likewise, 
old masters normally have more talent than 
young apprentices—unless the youth has an 
exceptional ability score! However, age is 
no assurance of talent. Remember that 
knowing a skill and being good at it are two 
different things. There are bad potters, 
mediocre potters, and true craftsmen. All 
this has much less to do with age than with 
dedication and talent. 


Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions 


The following pro- 
ficiency descriptions are arranged alphabet- 
ically, not according to character class. Each 
description gives a general outline of what a 
character with the proficiency knows and 
can do. Furthermore, some descriptions 
include rules to cover specific uses or situa- 
tions, or exact instructions on the effects of 
the proficiency. 


Agriculture: The character has a knowl- 
edge of the basics of farming. This includes 
planting, harvesting, storing crops, tending 
animals, butchering, and other typical 
farming chores. 

Ancient History: The character has 
learned the legends, lore, and history of 
some ancient time and place. The knowl- 
edge must be specific, just as a historian 
would specialize today in the English Mid- 
dle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or the 
Roman Republic before Caesar. (The DM 
either can have ancient periods in mind for 
his game or can allow the players to name 
and designate them.) Thus, a player charac- 
ter could know details about the Age of 
Thorac Dragonking or the Time of the Sea- 
Raiders or whatever else was available. 

The knowledge acquired gives the charac- 
ter familiarity with the principal legends, 
historical events, characters, locations, bat- 
tles, breakthroughs (scientific, cultural, and 
magical), unsolved mysteries, crafts, and 
oddities of the time. The character must roll 
a proficiency check to identify places or 
things he encounters from that age. For 
example, Rath knows quite a bit about the 
Coming of the Trolls, a particularly dark 
period of dwarven history. Moving through 
some deep caverns, he and his companions 
stumble across an ancient portal, sealed for 
untold ages. Studying the handiwork, he 
realizes (rolls a successful proficiency check) 
that it bears several seals similar to those he 
has seen on “banned” portals from the time 
of Angnar, doorways to the legendary 
realm of Trolhel. 

Animal Handling: Proficiency in this area 
enables a character to exercise a greater- 
than-normal degree of control over pack 
animals and beasts of burden. A successful 
proficiency check indicates that the charac- 
ter has succeeded in calming an excited or 


SS 


mex 
— 


7 


agitated animal; in contrast, a character 
without this proficiency has only a 20% 
chance of succeeding in the attempt. 

Animal Lore: This proficiency enables a 
character to observe the actions or habitat 
of an animal and interpret what is going on. 
Actions can show how dangerous the crea- 
ture is, whether it is hungry, protecting its 
young, or defending a nearby den. Further- 
more, careful observation of signs and 
behaviors can even indicate the location of a 
water hole, animal herd, predator, or 
impending danger, such as a forest fire. The 
DM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A 
successful check means the character under- 
stood the basic actions of the creature. If the 
check fails by 4 or less, no information is 
gained. If the check fails by 5 or more, the 
character misinterprets the actions of the 
animal. 

A character may also imitate the calls and 
cries of animals that he is reasonably familiar 
with, based on his background. This ability 
is limited by volume. The roar of a tyranno- 
saurus rex would be beyond the abilities of a 
normal character. A successful proficiency 
check means that only magical means can 
distinguish the character's call from that of 
the true animal. The cry is sufficient to fool 
animals, perhaps frightening them away or 


56 


RQ A 


luring them closer. A failed check means the 
sound is incorrect in some slight way. A 
failed call may still fool some listeners, but 
creatures very familiar with the cry automat- 
ically detect a false call. All other creatures 
and characters are allowed a Wisdom check 
to detect the fake. 

Finally, animal lore increases the chance 
of successfully setting snares and traps (for 
hunting) since the character knows the gen- 
eral habits of the creature hunted. 

Animal Training: Characters with this 
proficiency can train one type of creature 
(declared when the proficiency is chosen) to 
obey simple commands and perform tricks. 
A character can spend additional proficien- 
cies to train other types of creatures or can 
improve his skill with an already chosen 
type. Creatures typically trained are dogs, 
horses, falcons, pigeons, elephants, ferrets, 
and parrots. A character can choose even 
more exotic creatures and monsters with 
animal intelligence (although these are diffi- 
cult to control). 

A trainer can work with up to three crea- 
tures at one time. The trainer may choose to 
teach general tasks or specific tricks. A gen- 
eral task gives the creature the ability to 
react to a number of nonspecific commands 
to do its job. Examples of tasks include 


Proficiencies (Nonw 


guard and attack, carry a rider, perform 
heavy labor, hunt, track, or fight alongside 
soldiers (such as a war horse or elephant). A 
specific trick teaches the trained creature to 
do one specific action. A horse may rear on 
command, a falcon may pluck a designated 
object, a dog may attack a specific person, 
or a rat may run through a particular maze. 
With enough time, a creature can be trained 
-to do both general tasks and specific tricks. 

Training for a general task requires three 
months of uninterrupted work. Training for 
a specific trick requires 2d6 weeks. At the 
end of the training time, a proficiency check 
is made. If successful, the animal is trained. 
If the die roll fails, the beast is untrainable. 
An animal can be trained in 2d4 general 
tasks or specific tricks, or any combination 
of the two. 

An animal trainer can also try to tame 
wild animals (preparing them for training 
later on). Wild animals can be tamed only 
when they are very young. The taming 
requires one month of uninterrupted work 
with the creature. At the end of the month, a 
proficiency check is made. If successful, the 
beast is suitable for training. If the check 
fails, the creature retains enough of its wild 
behavior to make it untrainable. It can be 
kept, though it must be leashed or caged. 


Appraising: This proficiency is highly 
useful for thieves, as it allows characters to 
estimate the value and authenticity of 
antiques, art objects, jewelry, cut gem- 
stones, or other crafted items they find 
(although the DM can exclude those items 
too exotic or rare to be well known). The 
character must have the item in hand to 
examine. A successful proficiency check 
(rolled by the DM) enables the character to 
estimate the value of the item to the nearest 
100 or 1,000 gp and to identify fakes. On a 
failed check, the character cannot estimate a 
price at all. On a roll of 20, the character 
wildly misreads the value of the item, 
always to the detriment of the character. 

Armorer: This character can make all of 


the types of armor listed in the Player's 
Handbook, given the proper materials and 
facilities. When making armor, the profi- 
ciency check is rolled at the end of the nor- 
mal construction time. 

The time required to make armor is equal 
to two weeks per level of AC below 10. For 
example, a shield would require two weeks 
of work, whereas a suit of full plate armor 
would require 18 weeks of work. 

If the proficiency check indicates failure 
but is within 4 of the amount needed for suc- 
cess, the armorer has created usable, but 
flawed, armor. Such armor functions as 1 
AC worse than usual, although it looks like 
the armor it was intended to be. Only a 
character with armorer proficiency can 
detect the flaws, and this requires careful 
and detailed inspection. 

If the flawed armor is struck in melee 
combat with a natural die roll of 19 or 20, it 
breaks. The character's AC immediately 
worsens by 4 additional classes (although 
never above 10), and the broken armor 
hampers the character's movement. Until 
the character can remove the broken armor 
(a process requiring 1d4 rounds), the char- 
acter moves at !/2 of his normal rate and suf- 
fers a —4 penalty to all of his attack rolls. 

If an armorer is creating a suit of field 
plate or full plate armor, the character who 
will use the armor must be present at least 
once a week during the creation of the 
armor, since such types of armor require 
very exact fitting. 

Artistic Ability: Player characters with 
artistic ability are naturally accomplished in 
various forms of the arts. They have an 
inherent understanding of color, form, 
space, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Char- 
acters with artistic ability must select one 
art form (painting, sculpture, composition, 
etc.) to be proficient in. Thereafter they can 
attempt to create art works or musical com- 
positions in their given field. Although it is 
not necessary to make a proficiency check, 
one can be made to determine the quality of 
the work, If a 1 is rolled on the check, the 
artist has created a work with some truly 
lasting value. If the check fails, the artist has 
created something aesthetically unpleasing 
or just plain bad. 

Artistic ability also confers a +1 bonus to 
all proficiency checks requiring artistic 
skill—music or dance—and to attempts to 
appraise objects of art. 

Astrology: This proficiency gives the 
character some understanding of the sup- 
posed influences of the stars. Knowing the 
birth date and time of any person, the 
astrologer can study the stars and celestial 
events and then prepare a forecast of the 
future for that person. The astrologer's 
insight into the future is limited to the next 
30 days, and his knowledge is vague at best. 
If a successful proficiency check is made, the 
astrologer can foresee some general event— 


57 


a great battle, a friend lost, a new friendship 
made, etc. The DM decides the exact predic- 
tion (based on his intentions for the next few 
gaming sessions). Note that the prediction 
does not guarantee the result—it only indi- 
cates the potential result. If the proficiency 
check is failed, no information is gained 
unless a 20 is rolled, in which case the pre- 
diction is wildly inaccurate. 

Clearly this proficiency requires prepara- 
tion and advance knowledge on the part of 
the DM. Because of this, it is permissible for 
the DM to avoid the question, although this 
shouldn't be done all the time. Players who 
want to make their DM's life easier (always 
a good idea) should consider using this pro- 
ficiency at the end of a gaming session, giv- 
ing the DM until the next session to come up 
with an answer. The DM can use this profi- 
ciency as a catalyst and guide for his 
adventures—something that will prompt 
the player characters to go to certain places 
or to try new things. 

Characters with the astrology proficiency 
gain a +1 bonus to all navigation proficien- 
cy checks, provided the stars can be seen. 

Blacksmithing: A character with black- 
smithing proficiency is capable of making 
tools and implements from iron. Use of the 
proficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed 
fire and bellows, as well as a hammer and 
anvil. The character cannot make armor or 
most weapons, but can craft crowbars, 
grappling hooks, horseshoes, nails, hinges, 
plows, and most other iron objects. 

Blind-fighting: A character with blind- 
fighting is skilled at fighting in conditions of 
poor or no light (but this proficiency does 
not allow spell use). In total darkness, the 
character suffers only a —2 penalty to his 
attack roll (as compared to a —4 penalty 
without this proficiency). Under starlight or 
moonlight, the character incurs only a ~1 
penalty. The character suffers no penalties 
to his AC because of darkness. 

Furthermore, the character retains special 
abilities that would normally be lost in 
darkness, although the effectiveness of these 
are reduced by one-half (proficiency checks 
are made at half the normal score, etc.). 
This proficiency is effective only against 
opponents or threats within melee distance 
of the character. Blind-fighting does not 
grant any special protection from missile 
fire or anything outside the immediate range 
of the character's melee weapon. Thus AC 
penalties remain for missile fire. (By the 
time the character hears the whoosh of the 
arrow, for example, it is too late for him to 
react.) 

While moving in darkness, the character 
suffers only half the normal movement pen- 
alty of those without this proficiency. 

Furthermore, this skill aids the character 
when dealing with invisible creatures, 
reducing the attack penalty to —2. How- 
ever, it does not enable the character to dis- 


Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) 


cover invisible creatures; he has only a gen- 
eral idea of their location and cannot target 
them exactly. 

Bowyer/Fletcher: This character can 
make bows and arrows of the types given in 
Table 44, page 68. 

A weaponsmith is required to fashion 
arrowheads, but the bowyer/fletcher can 
perform all other necessary functions. The 
construction time for a long or short bow is 
one week, while composite bows require 
two weeks, and 1d6 arrows can be made in 
one day. 

When the construction time for the weap- 
on is completed, the player makes a profi- 
ciency check. If the check is successful, the 
weapon is of fine quality and will last for 
many years of normal use without break- 
ing. If the check fails, the weapon is still usa- 
ble, but has a limited life span: An arrow 
breaks on the first shot; a bow breaks if the 
character using it rolls an unmodified 1 on 
his 1d20 attack roll. 

Option: If a character wishes to create a 
weapon of truly fine quality and the DM 
allows it, the player can opt to use the fol- 
lowing alternative procedure for determin- 
ing the success of his attempt. When the 
proficiency check is made, any failure 
means that the weapon is useless. However, 
a successful check means that the weapon 
enables the character to add Strength 
bonuses to attack and damage rolls. Addi- 
tionally, if the proficiency check is a natural 
1, the range of the bow is increased 10 yards 
for all range classes or is of such fine work 
that it is suitable for enchantment. 

Brewing: The character is trained in the 
art of brewing beers and other strong drink. 
The character can prepare brewing formu- 
las, select quality ingredients, set up and 
manage a brewery, control fermentation, 
and age the finished product. 

Carpentry: The carpentry proficiency 
enables the character to do woodworking 
jobs: building houses, cabinetry, joinery, 
etc. Tools and materials must be available. 
The character can build basic items from 
experience, without the need for plans. 
Unusual and more complicated items (a cat- 
apult, for example) require plans prepared 
by an engineer. Truly unusual or highly 
complex items (wooden clockwork mecha- 
nisms, for example) require a proficiency 


check. 


Charioteering: A character with profi- 
ciency in this skill is able to safely guide a 
chariot, over any type of terrain that can 
normally be negotiated, at a rate 1/3 faster 
than the normal movement rate for a char- 
iot driven by a character without this profi- 
ciency. Note that this proficiency does not 
impart the ability to move a chariot over 
terrain that it cannot traverse; even the best 
charioteer in the world cannot take such a 
vehicle into the mountains. 

Cobbling: The character can fashion and 
repair shoes, boots, and sandals. 

Cooking: Although all characters have 
rudimentary cooking skills, the character 
with this proficiency is an accomplished 
cook. A proficiency check is required only 
when attempting to prepare a truly magnifi- 
cent meal worthy of a master chef. 

Dancing: The character knows many 
styles and varieties of dance, from folk 
dances to formal court balls. 

Direction Sense: A character with this 
proficiency has an innate sense of direction. 
By concentrating for 1d6 rounds, the char- 
acter can try to determine the direction the 
party is headed. If the check fails but is less 
than 20, the character errs by 90 degrees. If a 
20 is rolled, the direction chosen is exactly 
opposite the true heading. (The DM rolls 
the check.) 

Furthermore, when traveling in the wil- 
derness, a character with direction sense has 
the chance of becoming lost reduced by 5%. 

Disguise: The character with this skill is 
trained in the art of disguise. He can make 
himself look like any general type of person 
of about the same height, age, weight, and 
race. A successful proficiency check indi- 
cates that the disguise is successful, while a 
failed roll means the attempt was too obvi- 
ous in some way. 

The character can also disguise himself as 
a member of another race or sex. In this 
case, a —7 penalty is applied to the profi- 
ciency check. The character may also 
attempt to disguise himself as a specific per- 
son, with a —10 penalty to the proficiency 
check. These modifiers are cumulative, thus 
it is extremely difficult for a character to dis- 
guise himself as a specific person of another 
race or sex (a —17 penalty to the check). 

Endurance: A character with endurance 
proficiency is able to perform continual 
strenuous physical activity for twice as long 
as a normal character before becoming sub- 
ject to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion. 
In those cases where extreme endurance is 
required, a successful proficiency check 
must be made. Note that this proficiency 
does not enable a character to extend the 
length of time that he can remain unaffected 
by a lack of food or water. 

Engineering: The character is trained as a 
builder of both great and small things. Engi- 
neers can prepare plans for everything from 
simple machines (catapults, river locks, 


58 


grist mills) to large buildings (fortresses, 
dams). A proficiency check is required only 
when designing something particularly 
complicated or unusual. An engineer must 
still find talented workmen to carry out his 
plan, but he is trained to supervise and man- 
age their work. 

An engineer is also familiar with the prin- 
ciples of siegecraft and can detect flaws in 
the defenses of a castle or similar construc- 
tion. He knows how to construct and use 
siege weapons and machines, such as cata- 
pults, rams, and screws. 

Etiquette: This proficiency gives the char- 
acter a basic understanding of the proper 
forms of behavior and address required in 
many different situations, especially those 
involving nobility and persons of rank. 
Thus, the character will know the correct 
title to use when addressing a duke, the 
proper steps of ceremony to greet visiting 
diplomats, gestures to avoid in the presence 
of dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual 
occurrences, a proficiency check must be 
made for the character to know the proper 
etiquette for the situation (an imperial visit, 
for example, is a sufficiently rare event). 

However, having the character know 
what is correct and actually do what is cor- 
rect are two different matters, The encoun- 
ters must still be role-played by the 
character. Knowledge of etiquette does not 
give the character protection from a gaffe or 
faux pas; many people who know the cor- 
rect thing still manage to do the exact oppo- 
site. 

Fire-building: A character with fire- 
building proficiency does not normally need 
a tinderbox to start a fire. Given some dry 
wood and small pieces of tinder, he can start 
a fire in 2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not 
required. Wet wood, high winds, or other 
adverse conditions increase the time to 
3d20, and a successful proficiency check 
must be rolled to start a fire. 

Fishing: The character is skilled in the art 
of fishing, be it with hook and line, net, or 
spear. Each hour the character spends fish- 
ing, roll a proficiency check. If the roll is 
failed, no fish are caught that hour, Other- 
wise, a hook and line or a spear will land 
fish equal to the difference between the die 
roll and the character's Wisdom score. A net 
will catch three times this amount. 

Of course, no fish can be caught where no 
fish are found. On the other hand, some 
areas teem with fish, such as a river or pool 
during spawning season. The DM may 
modify the results according to the situa- 
tion. 

Forgery: This proficiency enables the 
character to create duplicates of documents 
and handwriting and to detect such forger- 
ies created by others. To forge a document 
(military orders, local decrees, etc.) where 
the handwriting is not specific to a person, 
the character needs only to have seen a simi- 


Proficiencies (Nonw 


lar document before. To forge a name, an 
autograph of that person is needed, and a 
proficiency check with a —2 penalty must 
be successfully rolled. To forge a longer doc- 
ument written in the hand of some particu- 
lar person, a large sample of his 
handwriting is needed, with a —3 penalty to 
the check. 

It is important to note that the forger 
always thinks he has been successful; the 
DM rolls the character's proficiency check 
in secret and the forger does not learn of a 
failure until it is too late. 

If the check succeeds, the work will pass 
examination by all except those intimately 
familiar with that handwriting or by those 
with the forgery proficiency who examine 
the document carefully. If the check is 
failed, the forgery is detectable to anyone 
familiar with the type of document or 
handwriting—if he examines the document 
closely, If the die roll is a 20, the forgery is 
immediately detectable to anyone who nor- 
mally handles such documents without 
close examination. The forger will not real- 
ize this until too late. 

Furthermore, those with forgery profi- 
ciency may examine a document to learn if 
it is a forgery. On a successful proficiency 
roll, the authenticity of any document can 
be ascertained. If the die roll is failed but a 
20 is not rolled, the answer is unknown. If a 
20 is rolled, the character reaches the incor- 
rect conclusion. 

Gaming: The character knows most com- 
mon games of chance and skill, including 
cards, dice, bones, draughts, and chess. 
When playing a game, the character may 
either play out the actual game (which may 
take too much time for some) or make a pro- 
ficiency check, with success indicating vic- 
tory. If two proficient characters play each 
other, the one with the highest successful die 
roll wins. A character with gaming profi- 
ciency can also attempt to cheat, thus gain- 
ing a +1 bonus to his ability score. If the 
proficiency check for the game is 17 to 20, 
however, the character has been caught 
cheating (even if he won the game). 

Gem Cutting: A character with this profi- 
ciency can finish the rough gems that are 
discovered through mining at a rate of 1d10 
stones per day. A gem cutter derives no ben- 
efit from the assistance of nonproficient 
characters. A gem cutter must work with a 
good light source and must have an assort- 
ment of chisels, smal] hammers, and special- 
ly hardened blades. 

Uncut gems, while still of value, are not 
nearly as valuable as the finished product. If 
the cutting is successful (as determined by a 
proficiency check), the gem cutter increases 
the value of a given stone to the range 
appropriate for its type. If a 1 is rolled, the 
work is exceptionally brilliant and the value 
of the gem falls into the range for the next 
most valuable gem (the DM has the relevant 


tables). 

Healing: A character proficient in healing 
knows how to use natural medicines and 
basic principles of first aid and doctoring. If 
the character tends another within one 
round of wounding (and makes a successful 
proficiency check), his ministrations restore 
1d3 hit points (but no more hit points can be 
restored than were lost in the previous 
round). Only one healing attempt can be 
made on a character per day. 

If a wounded character remains under the 
care of someone with healing proficiency, 
that character can recover lost hit points at 
the rate of 1 per day even when traveling or 
engaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the 
wounded character gets complete rest, he 
can recover 2 hit points per day while under 
such care. Only characters with both heal- 
ing and herbalism proficiencies can help 
others recover at the rate of 3 hit points per 
day of rest. This care does not require a pro- 
ficiency check, only the regular attention of 
the proficient character. Up to six patients 
can be cared for at any time. 

A character with healing proficiency can 
also attempt to aid a poisoned individual, 
provided the poison entered through a 
wound. If the poisoned character can be 
tended to immediately (the round after the 
character is poisoned) and the care con- 
tinues for the next five rounds, the victim 
gains a +2 bonus to his saving throw (delay 
his saving throw until the last round of tend- 
ing). No proficiency check is required, but 
the poisoned character must be tended to 
immediately (normally by sacrificing any 
other action by the proficient character) and 
cannot do anything himself. If the care and 
rest are interrupted, the poisoned character 
must immediately roll a normal saving 
throw for the poison. This result is unalter- 
able by normal means (i.e., more healing 
doesn't help). Only characters with both 
healing and herbalism proficiencies can 
attempt the same treatment for poisons the 
victim has swallowed or touched (the char- 
acter uses his healing to diagnose the poison 
and his herbalist knowledge to prepare a 
purgative). 

A character with healing proficiency can 
also attempt to diagnose and treat diseases. 
When dealing with normal diseases, a suc- 
cessful proficiency check automatically 
reduces the disease to its mildest form and 
shortest duration. Those who also have her- 
balism knowledge gain an additional +2 
bonus to this check. A proficient character 
can also attempt to deal with magical dis- 
eases, whether caused by spells or creatures. 
In this case, a successful proficiency check 
diagnoses the cause of the disease. How- 
ever, since the disease is magical in nature, it 
can be treated only by magical means. 

Heraldry: The knowledge of heraldry 
enables the character to identify the differ- 
ent crests and symbols that denote different 


59 


persons and groups. Heraldry comes in 
many forms and is used for many different 
purposes. It can be used to identify noble- 
men, families, guilds, sects, legions, politi- 
cal factions, and castes. The symbols may 
appear on flags, shields, helmets, badges, 
embroidery, standards, clothing, coins, and 
more. The symbols used may include geo- 
metric patterns, calligraphed lines of script, 
fantastic beasts, religious symbols, and 
magical seals (made for the express purpose 
of identification). Heraldry can vary from 
the highly formalized rules and regulations 
of late medieval Europe to the knowledge of 
different shield patterns and shapes used by 
African tribesmen. 

The character automatically knows the 
different heraldic symbols of his homeland 
and whom they are associated with. In addi- 
tion, if the character makes a successful pro- 
ficiency check, he can correctly identify the 
signs and symbols of other lands, provided 
he has at least a passing knowledge of the 
inhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is 
of little use upon first entering a foreign 
land. 

Herbalism: Those with herbalist knowl- 
edge can identify plants and fungus and pre- 
pare nonmagical potions, poultices, 
powders, balms, salves, ointments, infu- 
sions, and plasters for medical and pseudo- 
medical purposes. They can also prepare 
natural plant poisons and purgatives. The 
DM must decide the exact strength of such 
poisons based on the poison rules in the 
DMG., A character with both herbalism and 
healing proficiencies gains bonuses when 
using his healing talent (see the Healing pro- 
ficiency). 

Hunting: When in wilderness settings, the 
character can attempt to stalk and bring 
down game. A proficiency check must be 
made with a —1 penalty to the ability score 
for every nonproficient hunter in the party. 
If the die roll is successful, the hunter (and 
those with him) have come within 101 to 
200 yards (100 + 1d100) of an animal. The 
group can attempt to close the range, but a 
proficiency check must be made for each 20 
yards closed. If the stalking is successful, the 
hunter automatically surprises the game. 
The type of animal stalked depends on the 
nature of the terrain and the whim of the 
DM. 

Juggling: The character can juggle, a tal- 
ent useful for entertainments, diversions, 
and certain rare emergencies. When jug- 
gling normally (to entertain or distract), no 
proficiency check is required. A check is 
made when trying spectacular tricks 
(“Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!"), 
However, juggling also enables the charac- 
ter to attempt desperate moves. On a suc- 
cessful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a 
proficiency check), the character can catch 
small items thrown to harm him (as 
opposed to items thrown for him to catch).

Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) 


Thus the character could catch a dagger or a 
dart before it hits. If this attack roll fails, 
however, the character automatically suf- 
fers damage (sticking your hand in the path 
of a dagger is likely to hurt). 

Jumping: The character can attempt 
exceptional leaps both vertically and hor- 
izontally. If the character has at least a 20- 
foot running start, he can leap (broad jump) 
2d6 + his level in feet. No character can 
broad jump more than six times his height, 
however. With the same start, he can leap 
vertically (high jump) 1d3 plus half his level 
in feet. No character can high jump more 
than 17/2 times his own height. 

From a standing start, a character with 
this proficiency can broad jump 1dé6 plus 
half his level in feet and high jump only 
three feet. 

The character can also attempt vaults 
using a pole. A vault requires at least a 30- 
foot running start. If a pole is used, it must 
be four to 10 feet longer than the character's 
height. The vault spans a distance equal to 
17/2 times the length of the pole. The charac- 
ter can clear heights equal to the height of 
the pole. He can also choose to land on his 
feet if the vault carries him over an obstacle 
no higher than 1/2 the height of his pole. 
Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the character 
could either vault through a window 12 feet 
off the ground (tumbling into the room 
beyond), land on his feet in an opening six 
feet off the ground, or vault across a moat 
18 feet wide. In all cases, the pole is dropped 
at the end of the vault. 

Languages, Ancient: The character has 
mastered a difficult and obscure tongue, 
now primarily found in the writings of 
pedantic sages and sorcerers. The main use 
of the language is to read tomes of ancient 
secrets written by long-dead mystics. This 
proficiency enables the character to either 
read and write or speak the language (his 
choice). 

Languages, Modern: The character has 
learned to speak a language of the known 
world. To do so, there must be a teacher 
available. This could be another player 
character, an NPC hireling, or simply a 
local townsman. 

Leatherworking: This proficiency enables 
a character to tan and treat leather and to 
make clothing and other leather objects. 
The character can make leather armor, as 
well as backpacks, saddlebags, saddles, and 
all sorts of harnesses. 

Local History: The character is a store- 
house of facts about the history of a region 
the size of a large county or a small prov- 
ince. The character knows when the ruined 
tower on the hill was built and who built it 
(and what happened to him), what great 
heroes and villains fought and fell at the old 
battlefield, what great treasure is supposed 
to be kept in a local temple, how the mayor 
of the next town miraculously grew hair on 


his balding pate, and more. 

The DM will provide information about 
local sites and events as the character needs 
to know them. Furthermore, the character 
can try to retell these events as entertaining 
stories. Once the subject is chosen, he can 
either make a proficiency check and, if suc- 
cessful, add that tale to his repertoire, or 
actually tell the story to other characters. If 
the character succeeds in entertaining them, 
the player need not make a proficiency roll 
for the character, since he has succeeded. 
The character can tell these stories to enter- 
tain others, granting him a +2 bonus to his 
Charisma for the encounter. But telling sto- 
ries to hostile beings is probably not going 
to do any good. 

Mining: A character with mining profi- 
ciency is needed to site and supervise the 
operations of any mine. First, the character 
can attempt to determine what types of ores 
or gems can be found in a given area. To do 
this, he must spend at least a week searching 
a four-square-mile area. The DM may rule 
that more area must be searched to find any- 
thing of value and may thus increase the 
amount of time required. At the end of the 
search, the character can say what is likely 
to be found in this area. After this, the char- 
acter can site the mine. On a successful pro- 
ficiency check (made secretly by the DM), 
the character has found a good site to begin 
mining for any minerals that may be in the 
area. The check does not guarantee a suc- 
cessful mine, only that a particular site is the 
best choice in a given area. The DM must 
determine what minerals, if any, are to be 
found in the region of the mine. On a failed 
check, the character only thinks he has 
found a good site. Much effort is spent 
before the character is proved wrong, of 
course. 

Once the mine is in operation, a character 
with mining proficiency must remain on- 
site to supervise all work. Although this is a 
steady job, most player characters will find 
it better to hire an NPC for this purpose. 

Mountaineering: A character with this 
proficiency can make difficult and danger- 
ous climbs up steep slopes and cliffs with the 
aid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with 
mountaineering proficiency leads a party, 
placing the pitons (spikes) and guiding the 
others, all in the party can gain the benefit 
of his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide 
a party up a cliff face it could not otherwise 
climb. A character with this proficiency 
gains a 10 percent bonus per proficiency slot 
spent to his chance to climb any surface. 
Note that mountaineering is not the same as 
the thief’s climbing ability, since the latter 
does not require aids of any sort. 

Musical Instrument: The character can 
play a specific musical instrument. An addi- 
tional instrument can be added for every 
extra slot devoted to this proficiency. The 
character plays quite well, and no proficien- 


61 


cy check is normally required. The DM may 
direct the character to make a proficiency 
check in what he feels are extraordinary cir- 
cumstances. 

Navigation: The character has learned the 
arts of navigating by the stars, studying cur- 
rents, and watching for telltale signs of 
land, reefs, and hidden danger. This is not 
particularly useful on land. At sea, a suc- 
cessful proficiency check by the navigator 
reduces the chance of getting lost by 20 per- 
cent. 

Pottery: A character with this proficiency 
can create any type of clay vessel or con- 
tainer commonly used in the campaign 
world. The character requires a wheel and a 
kiln, as well as a supply of clay and glaze. 
The character can generally create two 
small- or medium-sized items or one large- 
sized item per day. The pieces of pottery 
must then be fired in the kiln for an addi- 
tional day. 

The raw materials involved cost three cp 
to make a small item, five cp to make a 
medium-sized item, and one sp to make a 
large item. 

Reading Lips: The character can under- 
stand the speech of those he can see but not 
hear. When this proficiency is chosen, the 
player must specify what language the char- 
acter can lip read (it must be a language the 
character can already speak). To use the 
proficiency, the character must be within 30 
feet of the speaker and be able to see him 
speak. A proficiency check is made. If the 
check fails, nothing is learned. If the check is 
successful, 70 percent of the conversation is 
understood. Since certain sounds are impos- 
sible to differentiate, the understanding of a 
lip-read conversation is never better than 
this. 

Reading/Writing: The character can read 
and write a modern language he can speak, 
provided there is someone available to teach 
the character (another PC, a hireling, or an 
NPC). This proficiency does not enable the 
character to learn ancient languages (see 
Languages, Ancient). 

Religion: Characters with religion profi- 
ciency know the common beliefs and cults 
of their homeland and the major faiths of 
neighboring regions. Ordinary information 
(type of religious symbol used, basic atti- 
tude of the faith, etc.) of any religion is 
automatically known by the character. Spe- 
cial information, such as how the clergy is 
organized or the significance of particular 
holy days, requires a proficiency check. 

Additional proficiencies spent on religion 
enable the character either to expand his 
general knowledge into more distant 
regions (using the guidelines above) or to 
gain precise information about a single 
faith. If the latter is chosen, the character is 
no longer required to make a proficiency 
check when answering questions about that 
religion. Such expert knowledge is highly 


Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) 


useful to priest characters when dealing 
with their own and rival faiths. 

Riding, Airborne: The character is trained 
in handling a flying mount. The particular 
creature must be chosen when the proficien- 
cy is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can 
be used to learn how to handle other types of 
mounts, Unlike land-based riding, a charac- 
ter must have this proficiency (or ride with 
someone who does) to handle a flying 
mount. In addition, a proficient character 
can do the following: 

* Leap onto the saddle of the creature 
(when it is standing on the ground) and spur 
it airborne as a single action. This requires 
no proficiency check. 

* Leap from the back of the mount and 
drop 10 feet to the ground or onto the back 
of another mount (land-based or flying). 
Those with only light encumbrance can 
drop to the ground without a proficiency 
check. In all other situations, a proficiency 
check is required. A failed roll means the 
character takes normal falling damage (for 
falling flat on his face) or misses his target 
(perhaps taking large amounts of damage as 
a result), A character who is dropping to the 
ground can attempt an immediate melee 
attack, if his proficiency check is made with 
a —4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure has 
the consequences given above. 

* Spur his mount to greater speeds on a 
successful check, adding 1d4 to the move- 


ment rate of the mount. This speed can be 
maintained for four consecutive rounds. If 
the check fails, an attempt can be made 
again the next round. If two checks fail, no 
attempt can be made for a full turn. After 
the rounds of increased speed, its movement 
drops to 2/3 its normal rate and its Maneu- 
verability Class (see Glossary) becomes one 
class worse. These conditions last until the 
mount lands and is allowed to rest for at 
least one hour. 

* The rider can guide the mount with his 
knees and feet, keeping his hands free. A 
proficiency check is made only after the 
character suffers damage. If the check is 
failed, the character is knocked from the 
saddle. A second check is allowed to see if 
the character manages to catch himself (thus 
hanging from the side by one hand or in 
some equally perilous position). If this fails, 
the rider falls. Of course a rider can strap 
himself into the saddle, although this could 
be a disadvantage if his mount is slain and 
plummets toward the ground. 

Riding, Land-Based: Those skilled in land 
riding are proficient in the art of riding and 
handling horses or other types of ground 
mounts. When the proficiency slot is filled, 
the character must declare which type of 
mount he is proficient in. Possibilities 
include griffons, unicorns, dire wolves, and 
virtually any creatures used as mounts by 
humans, demihumans, or humanoids. 


62 


A character with riding proficiency can 
perform all of the following feats. Some of 
them are automatic, while others require a 
proficiency check for success. 

* The character can vault onto a saddle 
whenever the horse or other mount is stand- 
ing still, even when the character is wearing 
armor. This does not require a proficiency 
check. The character must make a check, 
however, if he wishes to get the mount mov- 
ing during the same round in which he lands 
in its saddle. He must also make a proficien- 
cy check if he attempts to vault onto the sad- 
dle of a moving mount. Failure indicates 
that the character falls to the ground— 
presumably quite embarrassed. 

* The character can urge the mount to 
jump tall obstacles or leap across gaps. No 
check is required if the obstacle is less than 
three feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet 
wide. If the character wants to roll a profi- 
ciency check, the mount can be urged to 
leap obstacles up to seven feet high, or jump 
across gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success 
means that the mount has made the jump. 
Failure indicates that it balks, and the char- 
acter must make another proficiency check 
to see whether he retains his seat or falls to 
the ground. 

“ The character can spur his steed on to 
great speeds, adding 6 feet per round to the 
animal's movement rate for up to four 
turns. This requires a proficiency check 


Proficiencies (Nonw 


each turn to see if the mount can be pushed 
this hard. If the initial check fails, no further 
attempts may be made, but the mount can 
move normally. If the second or subsequent 
check fails, the mount immediately slows to 
a walk, and the character must dismount 
and lead the animal for a turn. In any event, 
after four turns of racing, the steed must be 
walked by its dismounted rider for one turn. 

* The character can guide his mount with 
his knees, enabling him to use weapons that 
require two hands (such as bows and two- 
handed swords) while mounted. This feat 
does not require a proficiency check unless 
the character takes damage while so riding. 
In this case, a check is required and failure 
means that the character falls to the ground 
and sustains an additional 1d6 points of 
damage. 

* The character can drop down and hang 
alongside the steed, using it as a shield 
against attack. The character cannot make 
an attack or wear armor while performing 
this feat. The character's Armor Class is 
lowered by 6 while this maneuver is per- 
formed. Any attacks that would have struck 
the character's normal Armor Class are con- 
sidered to have struck the mount instead. 
No proficiency check is required. 

* The character can leap from the back of 
his steed to the ground and make a melee 
attack against any character or creature 
within 10 feet. The player must roll a suc- 
cessful proficiency check with a —4 penalty 
to succeed. On a failed roll, the character 
fails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to the 
ground, and suffers 1d3 points of damage. 

Rope Use: This proficiency enables a 
character to accomplish amazing feats with 
rope. A character with rope use proficiency 
is familiar with all sorts of knots and can tie 
knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or 
loosen with a quick tug. If the character's 
hands are bound and held with a knot, he 
can roll a proficiency check (with a —6 pen- 
alty) to escape the bonds. 

This character gains a +2 bonus to all 
attacks made with a lasso. The character 
also receives a +10 percent bonus to all 
climbing checks made while he is using a 
rope, including attempts to belay (secure the 
end of a climbing rope) companions. 

Running: The character can move at 
twice his normal movement rate for a day. 
At the end of the day he must sleep for eight 
hours. After the first day's movement, the 
character must roll a proficiency check for 
success. If the die roll succeeds, the charac- 
ter can continue his running movement the 
next day. If the die roll fails, the character 
cannot use his running ability the next day. 
If involved in a battle during a day he spent 
running, he suffers a —1 penalty to his 
attack rolls. 

Seamanship: The character is familiar 
with boats and ships. He is qualified to 
work as a crewman, although he cannot 


actually navigate. Crews of trained seamen 
are necessary to manage any ship, and they 
improve the movement rates of inland boats 
by 50 percent. 

Seamstress/Tailor: The character can sew 
and design clothing. He can also do all kinds 
of embroidery and ornamental work. 
Although no proficiency check is required, 
the character must have at least needle and 
thread to work. 

Set Snares: The character can make sim- 
ple snares and traps, primarily to catch 
small game. These can include rope snares 
and spring traps. A proficiency check must 
be rolled when the snare is first constructed 
and every time the snare is set. A failed pro- 
ficiency check means the trap does not work 
for some reason. It may be that the work- 
manship was bad, the character left too 
much scent in the area, or he poorly con- 
cealed the finished work. The exact nature 
of the problem does not need to be known. 
The character can also attempt to set traps 
and snares for larger creatures: tiger pits 
and net snares, for example. A proficiency 
check must be rolled, this time with a —4 
penalty to the ability score. In both cases, 
setting a successful snare does not ensure 
that it catches anything, only that the snare 
works if triggered. The DM must decide if 
the trap is triggered. 

Thief characters (and only thieves) with 
this proficiency can also attempt to rig man- 
traps. These can involve such things as 
crossbows, deadfalls, spiked springboards, 
etc. The procedure is the same as that for 
setting a large snare. The DM must deter- 
mine the amount of damage caused by a 
man-trap. 

Setting a small snare or trap takes one 
hour of work. Setting a larger trap requires 
two to three people (only one need have the 
proficiency) and 2d4 hours of work. Setting 
a man-trap requires one or more people 
(depending on its nature) and 1d8 hours of 
work, To prepare any trap, the character 
must have appropriate materials on hand. 

Characters with animal lore proficiency 
gain a +2 bonus to their ability score when 
attempting to set a snare for the purposes of 
catching game. Their knowledge of animals 
and the woods serves them well for this pur- 
pose. They gain no benefit when attempting 
to trap monsters or intelligent beings. 

Singing: The character is an accom- 
plished singer and can use this ability to 
entertain others and perhaps earn a small 
living (note that bards can do this automati- 
cally). No proficiency check is required to 
sing. The character can also create choral 
works on a successful proficiency check. 

Spelicraft: Although this proficiency does 
not grant the character any spellcasting 
powers, it does give him familiarity with the 
different forms and rites of spellcasting. If 
he observes and overhears someone who is 
casting a spell, or if he examines the material 


63 


components used, he can attempt to identify 
the spell being cast. A proficiency check 
must be rolled to make a correct identifica- 
tion. Wizard specialists gain a +3 bonus to 
the check when attempting to identify magic 
of their own school. Note that since the 
spellcaster must be observed until the very 
instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency 
does not grant an advantage against combat 
spells. The proficiency is quite useful, how- 
ever, for identifying spells that would other- 
wise have no visible effect. 

Those talented in this proficiency also 
have a chance (equal to !/2 of their normal 
proficiency check) of recognizing magical or 
magically endowed constructs for what 
they are. 

Stonemasonry: A stonemason is able to 
build structures from stone so that they last 
many years. He can do simple stone carv- 
ings, such as lettering, columns, and flour- 
ishes. The stone can be mortared, carefully 
fitted without mortar, or loosely fitted and 
chinked with rocks and earth. A stonemas- 
on equipped with his tools (hammers, 
chisels, wedges, block and tackle) can build 
a plain section of wall one foot thick, ten 
feet long, and five feet high in one day, pro- 
vided the stone has already been cut. A 
stonemason can also supervise the work of 
unskilled Jaborers to quarry stone; one 
stonemason is needed for every five labor- 
ers. Dwarves are among the most accom- 
plished stonemasons in the world; they 
receive a +2 bonus when using this skill. 

Survival: This proficiency must be 
applied to a specific environment—i.e., a 
specific type of terrain and weather factors. 
Typical environments include arctic, wood- 
land, desert, steppe, mountain, or tropical. 
The character has basic survival knowledge 
for that terrain type. Additional proficiency 
slots can be used to add more types of ter- 
rain. 

A character skilled in survival has a basic 
knowledge of the hazards he might face in 
that land, He understands the effects of the 
weather and knows the proper steps to 
lessen the risk of exposure. He knows the 
methods to locate or gather drinkable 
water. He knows how to find basic, not nec- 
essarily appetizing, food where none is 
apparent, thus staving off starvation. Fur- 
thermore, a character with survival skill can 
instruct and aid others in the same situation. 
When using the proficiency to find food or 
water, the character must roll a proficiency 
check. If the check is failed, no more 
attempts can be made that day. 

The survival skill in no way releases the 
player characters from the hardships and 
horrors of being lost in the wilderness. At 
best it alleviates a small portion of the suf- 
fering. The food found is barely adequate, 
and water is discovered in miniscule 
amounts. It is still quite possible for a char- 
acter with survival knowledge to die in the 


Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) 


wilderness. Indeed, the little knowledge the 
character has may lead to overconfidence 
and doom! 

Swimming: A character with swimming 
proficiency knows how to swim and can 
move according to the rules given in the 
Swimming section (page 120). Those with- 
out this proficiency cannot swim. They can 
hold their breath and float, but they cannot 
move themselves about in the water. 

Tightrope Walking: The character can 
attempt to walk narrow ropes or beams 
with greater than normal chances of suc- 
cess. He can negotiate any narrow surface 
not angled up or down greater than 45 
degrees. Each round the character can walk 
60 feet. One proficiency check is made eve- 
ry 60 feet (or part thereof), with failure indi- 
cating a fall. The check is made with a — 10 
penalty to the ability score if the surface is 
one inch or less in width (a rope), a —5 pen- 
alty if two inches to six inches wide, and 
unmodified if seven inches to 12 inches 
wide. Wider than one foot requires no check 
for proficient characters under normal cir- 
cumstances. Every additional proficiency 
spent on tightrope walking reduces these 
penalties by 1, Use of a balancing rod reduc- 
es the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations in 
the line increases the penalties by 2 to 6. 

The character can attempt to fight while 
on a tightrope, but he suffers a —5 penalty 
to his attack roll and must roll a successful 
proficiency check at the beginning of each 
round to avoid falling off. Since the charac- 
ter cannot maneuver, he gains no adjust- 
ments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he 
is struck while on the rope, he must roll an 
immediate proficiency check to retain his 
balance. 

Tracking: Characters with tracking profi- 
ciency are able to follow the trail of crea- 
tures and characters across most types of 
terrain. Characters who are not rangers roll 
a proficiency check with a —6 penalty to 
their ability scores; rangers have no penalty 
to their ability scores. In addition, other 
modifiers are also applied to the attempt, 


according to Table 39. 

Table 39: TRACKING MODIFIERS 
Terrain Mod. 
Soft or muddy ground +4 
Thick brush, vines, or reeds +3 
Occasional signs of passage, dust +2 
Normal ground, wood floor 0 
Rocky ground or shallow water =10, 
Every two creatures in the group +1 
Every 12 hours since trail was made aa | 
Every hour of rain, snow, or sleet =§ 
Poor lighting (moon or starlight) -6 
Tracked party attempts to hide trail <5 


The modifiers in Table 39 are cum- 
ulative—total the modifiers for all condi- 
tions that apply and combine that with the 
tracker’s Wisdom score to get the modified 


chance to track. 

For example, if Thule’s Wisdom score is 
16 and he is trying to track through mud 
(+4), at night (—6), during a sleet storm 
(-—5), his chance to track is 9 (16 + 4 -6 
—5). (Thule is a ranger, so he does not suffer 
the —6 penalty for non-rangers tracking.) 

For tracking to succeed, the creature 
tracked must leave some type of trail. Thus 
it is virtually impossible to track flying or 
noncorporeal creatures. The DM may allow 
this in rare instances, but he should also 
assign substantial penalties to the attempt. 

To track a creature, the character must 
first find the trail. Indoors, the tracker must 
have seen the creature in the last 30 minutes 
and must begin tracking from the place last 
seen. Outdoors, the tracker must either 
have seen the creature, have eyewitness 
reports of its recent movement (“Yup, we 
saw them orcs just high-tail it up that trail 
there not but yesterday.’), or must have 
obvious evidence that the creature is in the 
area (such as a well-used game trail). If these 
conditions are met, a proficiency check is 
rolled. Success means a trail has been 
found. Failure means no trail is found. 
Another attempt cannot be made until the 
above conditions are met again under differ- 
ent circumstances. 

Once the trail is found, additional profi- 
ciency checks are rolled for the following 
situations: 

* The chance to track decreases (terrain, 
rain, creatures leaving the group, darkness, 
etc.). 

* A second track crosses the first. 

* The party resumes tracking after a halt 
(to rest, eat, fight, etc.). 

Once the tracker fails a proficiency check, 
another check can be rolled after spending 
at least one hour searching the area for new 
signs. If this check is failed, no further 
attempts can be made. If several trackers are 
following a trail, a +1 bonus is added to the 
ability score of the most adept tracker. Once 
he loses the trail, it is lost to all. 

If the modifiers lower the chance to track 
below 0 (e.g., the modifiers are — 11 and the 
character's Wisdom is 10), the trail is totally 
lost to that character and further tracking is 
impossible (even if the chance later 
improves). Other characters may be able to 
continue tracking, but that character can- 
not. 

A tracking character can also attempt to 
identify the type of creatures being followed 
and the approximate number by rolling a 
proficiency check. All the normal tracking 
modifiers apply. One identifying check can 
be rolled each time a check is rolled to fol- 
low the trail. A successful check identifies 
the creatures (provided the character has 
some knowledge of that type of creature) 
and gives a rough estimate of their numbers. 
Just how accurate this estimate is depends 
on the DM. 


64 


When following a trail, the character (and 
those with him) must slow down, the speed 
depending on the character's modified 
chance to track as found from Table 39. 


Table 40: MOVEMENT WHILE 
TRACKING 


Chance to Track Movement Rate 
1-6 1/4 normal 
7-14 1/2 normal 
14orgreater 3/4 normal 


In the earlier example, Thule has a modi- 
fied tracking chance of 9, so he moves at 1/2 
his normal movement rate. 

Tumbling: The character is practiced in 
all manner of acrobatics—dives, rolls, som- 
ersaults, handstands, flips, etc. Tumbling 
can only be performed while burdened with 
light encumbrance or less. Aside from enter- 
taining, the character with tumbling profi- 
ciency can improve his Armor Class by 4 
against attacks directed solely at him in any 
round of combat, provided he has the initia- 
tive and foregoes all attacks that round. 
When in unarmed combat he can improve 
his attack roll by 2. 

On a successful proficiency check, he suf- 
fers only one-half the normal damage from 
falls of 60 feet or less and none from falls of 
10 feet or less. Falls from greater heights 
result in normal damage. 

Ventriloquism: The character has learned 
the secrets of “throwing his voice.” Al- 
though not actually making sound come 
from somewhere else (like the spell), the 
character can deceive others into believing 
this to be so. When using ventriloquism, the 
supposed source of the sound must be rela- 
tively close to the character. The nature of 
the speaking object and the intelligence of 
those watching can modify the character's 
chance of success. If the character makes an 
obviously inanimate object talk (a book, 
mug, etc.), a —5 penalty is applied to his 
ability score. If a believable source (a PC or 
NPC) is made to appear to speak, a +2 
bonus is added to his ability score. The 
observer's intelligence modifies this as fol- 


lows: 


Intelligence Modifier 
less than 3 +6 
3-5 +4 
6-8 +2 
9-14 0 
15-16 =—7 
17-18 —2 
19+ -4 


A successful proficiency check means the 
character has successfully deceived his audi- 
ence. One check must be made for every 
sentence or response. The character is lim- 
ited to sounds he could normally make (thus 
the roar of a lion is somewhat beyond him). 

Since ventriloquism relies on deception, 
people’s knowledge of speech, and assump- 


Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions 


tions about what should and shouldn't talk, 


it is effective only on intelligent creatures. - 


Thus it has no effect on animals and the like. 
Furthermore, the audience must be watch- 
ing the character since part of the deception 
is visual (“Hey, his lips don’t move!”). Using 
ventriloquism to get someone to look 
behind him does not work, since the voice is 
not actually behind him (this requires the 
ventriloquism spell). All but those with the 
gullibility of children realize what is truly 
happening. They may be amused—or they 
may not be.

Weaponsmithing: This highly specialized 
proficiency enables a character to perform 
the difficult and highly exacting work 
involved in making metal weapons, particu- 
larly those with blades. The character 
blends some of the skill of the blacksmith 
with an ability to create blades of strength 
and sharpness. A fully equipped smithy is 
necessary to use this proficiency. 

The time and cost to make various types 
of weapons are listed on Table 41.

Weather Sense: This proficiency enables 
the character to make intelligent guesses 
about upcoming weather conditions. A suc- 
cessful proficiency check means the charac- 


ter has correctly guessed the general weath- 
er conditions in the next six hours. A failed 
check means the character read the signs 
wrong and forecast the weather incorrectly. 
The DM should roll the check secretly. A 
proficiency check can be made once every 
six hours. However, for every six hours of 
observation, the character gains a +1 bonus 
to his ability score (as he watches the weath- 
er change, the character gets a better sense 
of what is coming). This modifier is cumula- 
tive, although sleep or other activity that 
occupies the attention of the character for a 
long period negates any accumulated 
bonus. 

Sometimes impending weather condi- 
tions are so obvious that no proficiency 
check is required. It is difficult not to notice 
the tornado funnel tearing across the plain 
or the mass of dark clouds on the horizon 
obviously headed the character's way. In 
these cases, the player should be able to 
deduce what is about to happen to his char- 
acter anyway. 

Weaving: A character with weaving pro- 
ficiency is able to create garments, tapes- 
tries, and draperies from wool or cotton. 
The character requires a spinning apparatus 
and a loom. A weaver can create two square 
yards of material per day. 


Although your character has some impres- 
sive abilities and skills, he really isn’t going 
to be effective without the equipment neces- 
sary for adventuring. To get this equipment, 
he needs money. Not only does he need 
money to outfit himself, but your character 
also has to cover his living expenses. 

Although there are many different types 
of coins and currencies in the world, all 
prices and treasures in the AD&D® rules are 
given in standard coinage. Your DM may 
have specific names for different coins and 
may have different rates of exchange, but 
this is material particular to his campaign. 
He will tell you if there are differences from 
the coins listed here. The standard rate of 
exchange for each coin is given in Table 42. 

The basic coins are the copper piece (cp) 
and the silver piece (sp). These form the 
backbone of the monetary system and are 
the coins most frequently found in the 
hands of the common folk. Above these two 
coins is the much rarer gold piece (gp). This 
coin is seldom found in common use and 
mainly exists on paper as the standard 
money of account. This means it is used to 
measure the value of property and goods. 
Land values, ship cargoes, gemstones, and 
penalty bonds (royal court fines) are nor- 
mally calculated in gold pieces, although 
payment of such vast sums normally takes 
other forms. 

In addition to these coins, there are other 
unusual metals used in exchange. Most of 
these come from failed currencies. As such, 
they are viewed with skepticism by many 
honest folk. Principal among these coins are 
the electrum (ep) and platinum pieces (pp). 
These coins are rarely circulated, and most are 
hidden away in ancient treasure hoards. 

The value of each coin can also be figured 
by the following: 10 cp = 1sp; 5sp = lep; 
2ep = 1 gp; Sgp = 1 pp. 

However, remember that not all wealth is 
measured by coins. Wealth can take many 
forms—land, livestock, the right to collect 
taxes or customs, and jewelry are all mea- 
sures of wealth. Coins have no guaranteed 
value. A gold piece can buy a lot in a small 
village but won't go very far in a large city. 
This makes other forms of wealth, land for 
instance, all the more valuable. Indeed, 
many a piece of jewelry is actually a way of 
carrying one's wealth. Silver armbands can 
be traded for goods, a golden brooch can 
buy a cow, etc. In your adventures, wealth 
and riches may take many different forms. 

Furthermore, in your DM's campaign, 
there may be special situations or consider- 
ations to bear in mind. The Kingdom of 
Gonfli may be at war with the neighboring 
Principality of Boosk. Patriotic Gonflians 
might refuse Boosk coins (probably because 
they think the coins are worthless). Practi- 
cal Booskites might accept the Gonfli florin 
at half normal value (so they can melt them 
down and mint new Boosk drachmas). Of

course, both groups would send your char- 
acter to the local money changer (if there is 
one), who would cheerfully convert your 
foreign coins to the local tender. He will, of 
course, charge a small commission (10- 
30%) for this service. 

Situations such as these can affect the val- 
ue of any coin. If your characters start flash- 
ing about a lot of gold, pumping it into the 
local economy, merchants will quickly raise 
prices. As another example, the local lord 
may commandeer most of the region's 
horses for his knights, making those left all 
that much more expensive. 


Starting Money 


All player charac- 
ters begin with some amount of cash. This 
nest egg may be your character's life sav- 
ings. It may be a gift from his parents to 
start him out in the world. It may be his 
booty from an army campaign. Perhaps he 
stumbled across a small treasure chest, 
whetting his appetite for greater and more 
dangerous prizes. How he came by his 
money is not important (although it may be 
fun to know). You are free to create any 
explanation you want. 

To learn your character's starting funds, 
roll the dice indicated for his group in Table 
43. This is the number of gold pieces your 
character has to obtain equipment. If you 
are creating a character starting out at a 
level above Ist level, check with the DM to 
see if you can increase your character's 
funds beyond the amounts given here. 

Multi-class characters use the most 
advantageous die range of their classes.

Character Group Die Range 
Warrior 5d4 X 10 gp 
Wizard (1d4+1) X 10 gp 
Rogue 2d6 X 10 gp 
Priest * 3d6 X 10 gp 


* Priest characters can use their money 
only to purchase equipment and goods. 
Once all purchases are made, the priest 
character must return all but two or three of 
his remaining gold pieces to his superiors 
(since his equipment is supplied by his orga- 
nization). Priests cannot lend any of their 
initial funds to other characters.

Equipment Lists 


The following lists 
include much of the equipment your charac- 
ter needs for adventuring. The most basic of 
these are weapons, armor, clothing, and 
outfitting gear. The other lists provide 
goods and services your character may need 
during the course of his many adventures. 
While most items are always available, your 
DM may add to or delete from these lists. 
What you want may not be available or, if 
your DM has set his game in a specific time 
period, may not have been discovered or 
invented yet! While he should tell you 
which items are and aren't available, you 
should ask if you have any doubts, particu- 
larly on large purchases. 

Many of the uncommon items in these 
lists are explained in the following pages. 

The price given for each item in the lists is 
its average price, the amount you can expect 
the item to cost in a normal economy. How- 
ever, large cities, barren wildernesses, and 
places with brave adventurers carrying bags 
full of gold are not normal economies. In 
these places you may find yourself paying 
more (very rarely less) than the amount list- 
ed. You can also haggle with merchants over 
prices, although to speed up the game it's 
recommended that you save this for your 
important purchases. If you wind up hag- 
gling over the cost of every tankard of ale, 
your character is going to spend more time 
being a pennypincher than an adventurer!

“ROF’ is the rate of fire—how many shots 
that weapon can fire off in one round. This 
is independent of the number of melee 
attacks a character can make in a round. 

Range is given in tens of yards. Each 
range category (Short, Medium, or Long) 
includes attacks from distances equal to or 
less than the given range. Thus a heavy 
crossbow fired at a target 136 yards away 
uses the medium-range modifier. 

The modifiers for range are — 2 for medi- 
um range and —5 for long range. 

Arquebuses (if allowed) double all range 
modifiers. 


Equipment Descriptions 


Not every piece of 
equipment is described here. The vast 
majority of things found on the equipment 
lists need no description, as their functions, 
forms, and purposes are obvious. Only 
those items whose use is obscure or appear- 
ance is unusual are described below. Spe- 
cific game effects of equipment are given in 
the appropriate sections of the rules. 


Tack and Harness 


Barding: A war 
horse, or any animal trained for combat, is 
a considerable investment for the average 
warrior. Therefore it behooves the owner to 
see that his mount is as well-protected as 
possible. Other than avoiding risks, the best 
nonmagical protection is horse armor or 
barding. Barding is simply some type of 
armor fitted to be worn by the mount. Full 
barding covers the neck, chest, and body of 
the beast, while half barding covers the 
head, neck, chest, and front quarters. Bard- 
ing can be made from many different mate- 
rials; stouter types provide increasing 
protection according to the Armor Class of 
the construction. All of this, however, is at 
the expense of increased weight and lowered 
maneuverability of the mount. Plate bard- 
ing, for example, is the equivalent of a war- 
rior’s field plate and is made of carefully 
interlocked plates and joints. It provides an 
Armor Class of 2 to the mount. It weighs at 
least 80 to 100 pounds at the lightest and 
thus a fully equipped war horse with this 
armor can manage little more than a steady 
trot at top speed. 

Barded animals also require special atten- 
tion, Care must be taken to prevent chafing 
and sores. The mount cannot wear the 
armor indefinitely. It must be removed at 
night and ideally should not be worn except 
in preparation for a battle or tournament. 
Removing horse barding takes 15 minutes 
for leather and 30 minutes for metal armors. 
Fitting it on takes twice as long. The weight 
of barding is carefully distributed to 
account for the weight of the armor and the 
rider, so barded animals cannot be used as 


pack animals! It is normal practice to havea 
second mount for carrying gear and sup- 
plies. 

When barding is fitted over a mount 
whose natural Armor Class is better than 
the barding, some protection is still gained. 
This is explained under Armor on page 76. 

In addition to horses and elephants, it 
may be possible to fit barding on more 
fantastic mounts. Flying steeds can wear 
only leather or magical barding. Aquatic 
creatures cannot wear normal barding 
although extremely rare magical pieces may 
exist. Other land creatures can certainly be 
barded, provided your DM rules that they 
are sturdy enough to carry the weight of 
armor and rider. Camels, for instance, are 
seldom barded for this reason. A huge 
ostrich would not be able to carry barding, 
since its legs would not support the weight. 

Saddles: There two basic saddles—riding 
and pack. Riding saddles take many forms, 
but their basic purpose is to carry a person. 
If your DM has set his campaign in an 
ancient or early Medieval setting, saddles 
may be without stirrups. Ask your DM to 
be sure. Pack saddles are special frames 
designed to carry supplies and equipment. 
The only practical limit to how much a well- 
stowed pack saddle can carry is the carrying 
ability of the animal. 


Transport 

Caravel: This ship 
was sailed in late Medieval/early Renais- 
sance times and was the type of ship Colum- 
bus used to reach the New World. (It should 
be used only in late Medieval settings.) It 
normally has two or three masts and square 
sails. No oars are used. The typical caravel 
is 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The normal 
crew is from 30 to 40 men. The average car- 
go displacement is 150-200 tons. 

Coaster: Also called a round ship, this is a 
small merchant ship that hugs the coasts. 
This is a sailing ship, fitted with two masts 
and triangular sails. The average size is 60 to 
70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The rudder 
hangs from one side. The crew is 20 to 30 
men, and the cargo capacity is about 100 
tons. Normally there is only a small stern- 
castle. A coaster is slow and not tremen- 
dously seaworthy, but it can carry large 
amounts of cargo with smaller crews than 
galleys. 

Cog: This ship is a larger, improved ver- 
sion of the coaster, able to make ventures 
into the open sea. Like the coaster, it is a 
sailing ship with one or two masts, but the 
cog employs square sails. It is about 75 to 90 
feet long and 20 feet wide. The crew is only 
18 to 20 men. There is normally one deck 
and fore- and sterncastles. The cargo capac- 
ities of cogs vary greatly, but the average is 
100 to 200 tons. 

Currach: This ship is an early, primitive 


71 


Equipment (Descriptions) 


vessel. It is made from thick hides stretched 
over a wood-and-wicker frame. A single 
mast carries a small] square sail, but the cur- 
ragh is usually worked by oars. It is normal- 
ly 20 to 40 feet long. The crew is approx- 
imately six to eight and the cargo space is 
limited—no more than five tons. 

Drakkar: The largest of the Viking long- 
ships is known as a drakkar or dragonship. 
Built for war, this ship stretches about 100 
feet in length. Although a single mast can be 
raised, oars provide the main source of 
power. The crew of 60 to 80 men rows, one 
man to an oar. Up to 160 additional men can 
be carried for boarding and raiding. Due to 
its great size, a drakkar is not very seawor- 
thy. This and the fact that there is no space 
on board for many supplies (certainly not 
enough for 240 men) or sleeping quarters 
keep the drakkar close to the coast where it 
can put in for the night. Because of its cost 
and limited use, a drakkar is usually built by 
kings and rulers and is not used for the mun- 
dane task of shipping cargo. 

Dromond: This ship is the largest of the 
Byzantine galleys. Although it boasts one or 
two masts and triangular sails, the main 
power comes from the 100 oars, 50 to a side. 
These oars are divided into an upper and 
lower bank, with one man per oar on the 
lower bank and three men on the upper 
bank. Thus, the total crew is about 200 
men. The dromond is about 130 to 175 feet 
long and 15 feet wide, making it a very slen- 
der ship. The cargo capacity is around 70 to 
100 tons. 

A dromond can be used both for shipping 
and war. As a warship, a ram projects from 
the front just above the water line. Castles 
are built fore, aft, and amidships as firing 
platforms. The cargo space is then taken up 
by marines. With such numbers of men, it is 
a very dangerous ship to attack. A dromond 
is not a seaworthy craft, however, and usu- 
ally sails in sight of shore. They beach at 
night like all galleys, since supplies and 
sleeping accommodations are very limited. 

Galleon: This is the largest and most 
advanced sailing ship that might be availa- 
ble in the AD&D® game. It should appear 
only in Renaissance-period settings. It is a 
sail-driven ship with three or four masts. 
There are normally three through decks 
(running the length of the ship), while the 
castles fore and aft have two decks. The 
average size is about 130 feet long and 30 
feet wide. Crews average about 130 men. 
Although cargo capacity is about 500 tons, 
a galleon is mainly used as a warship. (In the 
real world they were fitted with cannon, 
something beyond the standard AD&D® 
game rules.) They can easily carry men 
equal to their tonnage, making capture by 
pirates nearly impossible. 

Great Galley: Built during the Late Mid- 
dle Ages, the great galley is an improved 
version of the dromond. It is slightly smaller 


than the dromond, about 130 feet long and 
20 feet wide. The main power comes from 
140 rowers, one man to an oar but is supple- 
mented by three masts; this combination 
gives it better speed and handling. The car- 
go capacity is 150 tons. When outfitted as a 
warship, the front end is built as a ram and 
marines are carried instead of cargo. Like all 
galleys, the great galley is a coastal vessel, 
rarely venturing into open water. It is not 
seaworthy in heavy storms and waits in 
port for these to pass. 

Knarr: This small ship was a common car- 
go ship of the Scandinavian region. It is 50 
to 75 feet long and 15 to 20 feet wide. It hasa 
single mast and a square sail. In times of 
poor wind, a few oars at the bow and stern 
can provide more power. The crew ranges 
from eight to 14 men. The cargo capacity is 
small, anywhere from ten to 50 tons. The 
ship is, however, relatively seaworthy and 
can be used to make long sea voyages 
(although it cannot be called comfortable). 
Its flat bottom makes it useful for sailing up 
rivers and estuaries, and it can be beached 
easily. 

Longship: This is the standard Viking 
warship. It is more substantial than the 
knarr but not nearly as massive as the 
drakkar. An average longship is 75 feet long 
with 20 to 25 oars per side. Each oar is 
worked by a single man for a total crew of 
40 to 50 men. There is also a single mast and 


Equipment (Descriptions) 


a square sail. In addition to the crew, the 
ship can carry an additional 120 to 150 men. 
A longship can be used for shipping, but its 
cargo capacity is only about 50 tons. It is, 
however, fairly seaworthy and can sail 
across the open sea when necessary. 


Miscellaneous Equipment 


Holy Item: Holy 
items are small representations of all those 
things revered by religions—stars, crosses, 
hammers, rosaries, anointed oils, blessed 
wine, sacred teachings, and more. Just what 
constitutes a holy item depends on the cam- 
paign your character is in. All good holy 
items have similar effects on undead and 
other evil creatures, provided they are 
wielded by a follower of a belief associated 
with these items. Thus, rules that refer to 
holy symbols and holy water apply to all 
similar items, provided these items are spe- 
cially prepared by the cleric’s order. 

Because of their special nature, holy items 
cannot normally be purchased. Different 
sects tend to protect the symbols of their 
faith to prevent their misuse or corruption. 
Therefore such items must be obtained 
through the auspices of a local congrega- 
tion. This is not difficult for sincere fol- 
lowers of that faith, although requests for 
rare or unusual items must always be justi- 
fied. Nonbelievers are given holy items only 


if there is a clear and present danger to the 
faith. 

Lanterns: A hooded lantern (30-foot radi- 
us of light) is a standard lantern with shut- 
tered or hinged sides. It is not directional, as 
its light is cast equally in all directions. A 
bullseye lantern (60-foot radius of light) has 
only a single shutter, the other sides being 
highly polished to reflect the light in a single 
direction. Both hooded and bullseye lan- 
terns can be carried in one hand. A single 
flask of oil (one pint) burns for six hours in 
either. 

The beacon lantern (240-foot radius of 
light) is a much larger affair and must be 
mounted on the prow of a ship, the bed of a 
wagon, or other large structure. It operates 
like the bullseye lantern but illuminates to a 
greater distance. The beacon goes through 
oil quickly, burning a flask every two hours. 

Locks: Locks are still fairly primitive 
affairs (except for those complicated by the 
use of magic). All are worked with a large 
bulky key. Combination locks are virtually 
unknown at this time. As with most things, 
there are good, very complex locks as well 
as bad, easily opened locks. 

Magnifying Glass: This simple lens is 
more an oddity than a useful tool. It does 
not greatly enhance viewing, especially 
since many are unevenly ground, creating 
distortion. It is useful as a substitute for tin- 
der and steel when starting fires. 


72 


Merchant's Scale: This is a small balance 
and pans along with a suitable assortment 
of weights. Its main use is to weigh coins— 
a common method of settling a transac- 
tion. Merchants are well aware that coins 
can be undersized, shaved, or plated. The 
only sound protection is to check the coins 
against a set of established weights. It is 
also needed when using foreign coins to 
make a purchase or exchange. Of course, 
merchants are no more noble than anyone 
else and may use sets of false weights—one 
set heavier than normal for selling an item 
(causing the customer to pay more) and an- 
other set lighter than usual for buying 
items (letting the merchant pay less). In 
well-regulated areas, officials verify the ac- 
curacy of weights and measures, but this in 
itself is no protection. Players may wish to 
have a scale and weights for their own pro- 
tection. 

Oil: Greek fire is a general name given to 
all highly flammable oils used in combat. 
(Historically, Greek fire was a special com- 
bination of oil and chemicals that was sticky 
and difficult to extinguish.) These oils are 
highly flammable and a little dangerous to 
carry. Lamp oil is used for lamps and lan- 
terns. It is not particularly explosive al- 
though it can be used to feed an existing 
blaze. 

Spyglass: Like the magnifying glass, the 
spyglass is more of an oddity than a useful 
item. Objects viewed through it are a little 
closer, although not much. For better re- 
sults, magical items are preferred. The spy- 
glass gives from two to three times 
magnification. 

Thieves’ Picks: This is a small collection 
of tools useful to burglars. The kit includes 
one or more skeleton keys, long metal 
picks, a long-nosed clamp, a small hand 
saw, and a small wedge and hammer, These 
combined with some common tools (such as 
a crowbar) make up most of the special 
equipment a thief needs to perform his 
trade. 

Water Clock: This bulky item is good for 
giving the time accurate to a half-hour. Acti- 
vated by a regulated flow of drops, the wa- 
ter clock is not something you carry in your 
pocket. For it to work at all, it must have a 
source of water and be left undisturbed. A 
very uncommon item, it is primarily an 
amusement for the wealthy and a tool for 
the student of arcane lore. The vast major- 
ity of society is not concerned with exact 
time. 


Weapons 


The Weapons Table 
lists more than just the price of each item. It 
also gives other game information. Since 
each weapon is different, you should note 
this information separately for each weapon 
your character purchases or finds. 


Weapon Size: All weapons are classed ac- 
cording to a size category—S, M, L, G, or 
H. Small (S) weapons are approximately 
two feet or less in size; medium (M) weap- 
ons are two to five feet long; large (L) weap- 
ons are generally six feet or greater in 
length. Giant (G) and huge (H) weapons are 
not found on the lists, since these are items 
normally used by ogres, giants, and even 
greater creatures. They are not items of 
equipment a PC can normally buy! 

A character can always wield a weapon 
equal to his own size or less. Normally this 
requires only one hand, except for some 
missile weapons (bows and crossbows in 
particular). A character can also use a 
weapon one size greater than himself al- 
though it must be gripped with two hands. 
Beyond this size limit, the weapon is not us- 
able without special means (most often 
magical). 

Drelb the halfling (size S) can use a short 
sword with no difficulty (a size S weapon), 
or a long sword with two hands (a size M 
weapon), but a glaive (size L) is just too 
large for him to wield. Likewise, he can use 
a short bow but is unable to handle a long 
bow. 

Type: Weapons are classified according to 
types—bludgeoning (B), piercing (P), and 
slashing (S). These types are used to deter- 
mine armor type modifiers (if these are 
used). Weapons vs. Armor Type is ex- 
plained in Chapter 9: Combat (page 89). 

Speed Factor: Weapon speed is a relative 
measure of the clumsiness of the weapon. 
The lower the number, the quicker and eas- 
ier the weapon is to use. Weapon speed is ex- 
plained in Chapter 9: Combat. 

Damage: All weapons are rated for the 
amount of damage they can cause to small- 
and medium-sized creatures (S-M) and 
larger-than-man-sized creatures (L). 


Arquebus: This weapon may be disal- 
lowed by your DM and you must check 
with him before you purchase it. An arque- 
bus is an early form of the musket, almost 
as dangerous to its user as it is to the target. 
To use an arquebus, you must have a sup- 
ply of powder and shot and a piece of slow- 
burning match or cord. These items may or 
may not be commonly available. (Powder 
is treated as a magical item in these rules.) 
The weapon can be fired only once every 
three rounds, and then only if the character 
is not attacked while loading. When firing 
an arquebus, all penalties for range are 
doubled. 

If the attack roll for the arquebus is a 1 or 
2, the weapon backfires, causing 1d6 points 
of damage to the firer. It is also fouled and 
cannot be used again until it has been 
cleaned, which takes about 30 minutes, 
When a arquebus scores a hit, it normally 
does 1 to 9 points of damage on 1d10. When 
a 10 is rolled, the die is rolled again and this 


73 


Equipment (Descriptions) 


amount is added to 10. Each time a 10 is 
rolled, the die is rolled again and added to 
the previous total. Thus, in a rare instance, 
a single shot could inflict 37 points, for ex- 
ample, if three consecutive 10s were rolled, 
followed by a 7. The damage caused by an 
arquebus is never modified for a high 
Strength score. 

Bows: Bows come in various shapes and 
sizes. The power of a bow is measured by its 
pull. The greater the pull, the more Strength 
needed to work the bow. Thus it is possible 
for characters to have bows that grant them 
damage bonuses for high Strength (it is as- 
sumed the character has chosen a bow that 
has a greater pull). Likewise, characters 
with low Strengths suffer their usual penal- 
ties when using a bow (they are forced to use 
weaker bows or simply cannot draw back as 
far). The pull of a bow seldom prevents a 
character from using the weapon, only from 
gaining the full effect. The true test of a 
character's Strength comes in stringing a 
bow—the bow of a strong hero may simply 
be unstringable by a lesser man (as was 
Odysseus’s). 

Heavier pull bows are not normally any 
more expensive than standard bows. The 
exceptions to this are those bows that enable 
the fighter to gain bonuses for exceptional 
Strength (18/01 or greater). These bows 
must be custom crafted and cost three to 
five times the normal price. These bows are 
also difficult to string or use effectively for 
those without exceptional Strength. These 
characters must roll a successful bend bars/ 
lift gates roll to string or use such weapons 
(again, think of the test of the suitors in 
Odysseus’s household). 

Arrows for long bows of all types are di- 
vided between light-weight flight arrows 
and heavier sheaf arrows. Flight arrows 
have longer ranges and are normally used in 
hunting. Sheaf arrows have a stronger metal 
head but a reduced range. They are often 
used in times of war. 

Crossbow: Strength bonuses or penalties 
do not apply to crossbows, since these are 
purely mechanical devices. The hand cross- 
bow is easily held in one hand and cocked 
with the other. The light crossbow, also 
called latches, must be braced against an ob- 
ject to be cocked with a lever mounted on 
the stock. The heavy crossbow, also called 
arbalest, has a powerful pull and must be 
cocked with a cranequin (a simple winch or 
lever) that comes with the weapon. One 
foot is placed in a stirrup at the end of the 
crossbow while the cranequin is worked. 
All crossbows fire quarrels or bolts and the 
correct size must be used with each weapon. 

Lance: The different lances are rated ac- 
cording to size and sturdiness. Each type 
can be used only if the rider is on the same 
type of horse or a greater one. A man ona 
light war horse could not use a heavy horse 
lance, if only because the impact would 


bowl him and the horse right over! Further- 
more, the heavy and jousting lances require 
that the rider is firmly in a saddle and using 
stirrups. The jousting lance is a heavy horse 
lance modified for use in tournaments, in 
which the desire is not to kill the opponent. 
The end of the lance is fitted with a special 
blunted tip intended to lessen the chance of 
wounds. Of course, good intentions often 
go awry, so there is still a chance of injury 
during a joust. 

Mancatcher: This item is a highly special- 
ized type of polearm designed to capture 
without killing a victim. It consists of a long 
pole with a spring-loaded set of sharpened 
jaws at the end. The victim is caught 
between the arms, which then snap shut. 
The mancatcher is effective only on man- 
sized creatures. The target is always treated 
as AC 10, modified for Dexterity. If a hit is 
scored, the character is caught. The caught 
victim loses all shield and Dexterity bonuses 
and can be pushed and pulled about. This 
causes an automatic 1d2 points of damage 
per round and gives a 25% chance of pulling 
the victim to the ground. The victim can 
escape on a successful bend bars/lift gates 
roll, although this results in 1d2 points more 
damage. A common tactic is to use the 
weapon to pull horsemen off their mounts, 
then pin them to the ground. 

Polearms: A popular group of weapons 
during the ancient and Medieval periods 
were the polearms. Their length was a dis- 
tinct advantage and, for the peasant, they 
were a relatively easy weapon to make. 
Thus there came to be an abundance of 
polearms of different sizes and shapes. Due 
to their numbers, there is no standard sys- 
tem for naming polearms. The names used 
in the AD&D® game might possibly be 
applied to other weapons elsewhere. 

Because of their length, all polearms are 
infantry weapons and require two hands to 
use. They are almost always the weapon of 
the common peasant and soldier, who, lack- 
ing a horse and heavy armor, needs some 
weapon to keep the enemy’s knights at bay. 
Thus most polearms are intended to be used 
in close-packed formations that present a 
forest of sharp points and wicked blades to 
any knight foolish enough to charge. 

Awl Pike: Essentially this is a long spear 
12 to 20 feet long ending in a spike point of 
tapered spear head. It was a popular weap- 
on during the Renaissance. Since the pike 
stuck out in front, men could be packed 
side-by-side in dense formations, and sev- 
eral rows of men could fight. Large blocks 
of pikemen made formidable troops. How- 
ever, once the pikemen engaged in close 
combat, they normally dropped their clum- 
sy awl pikes and fought hand-to-hand with 
short swords. 

Bardiche: One of the simplest of 
polearms, the bardiche is an elongated bat- 
tle axe. A large curving axe-head is mounted 


Equipment (Descriptions) 


on the end of a Five- to eight-foot-long shaft. 
It probably grew out of common peasant 
tools and was popular with them. One rela- 
tive disadvantage is that the bardiche 
required more space to wield than a pike or 
a spear. 

Bec de corbin: This was a highly special- 
ized weapon of the upper classes during the 
Late Middle Ages and the early Renais- 
sance. It is an early can-opener designed 
specifically to deal with plate armor. The 
pick or beak is made to punch through 
plate, while the hammer side can be used to 
give a stiff blow. The end is fitted with a 
short blade for dealing with unarmored or 
helpless foes. The weapon is about eight feet 
long. Since the weapon relies on impact, a 
great deal of swinging space is needed. 

Bill-guisarme: A particularly bizarre- 
looking combination weapon, the bill- 
guisarme is an outgrowth of the common 
bill hook. Mounted on a seven- to eight- 
foot-long pole, it has a combination of a 
heavy, cleaver blade, a jutting back spike, 
and a hook or spike on the end. Thus, it can 
be used in several different ways. Like most 
polearms, it requires lots of room to use. 

Fauchard: An outgrowth of the sickle and 
scythe, the fauchard is a long, inward curv- 
ing blade mounted on a shaft six to eight feet 
long. It can slash or thrust, although the 
inward curving point makes thrusting rath- 
er ineffective. Its advantage is that a peasant 
can easily convert his common scythe into 
this weapon of war. 

Fauchard-fork: This is an attempted 
improvement on the fauchard, adding a 
long spike or fork to the back of the blade. 
Supposedly this improves the thrusting abil- 
ity of the weapon. It is still an inefficient 
weapon. 

Glaive: One of the most basic polearms, 
the glaive is a single-edged blade mounted 
on a eight- to ten-foot-long shaft. While not 
the most efficient weapon, it is relatively 
easy to make and use. Normally the blade 
turns outward to increase the cutting area 
until it almost resembles a cleaver or axe. 

Glaive-guisarme: Another combination 
weapon, this one takes the basic glaive and 
adds a spike or hook to the back of the 
blade. In theory, this increases the useful- 
ness of the weapon although its actual appli- 
cation is somewhat questionable. 

Guisarme: Thought to have derived from 
a pruning hook, this is an elaborately 
curved heavy blade. While convenient and 
handy, it is not very effective. 

Guisarme-voulge: This weapon has a 
modified axe blade mounted on an eight- 
foot-long shaft. The end of the blade tapers 
to a point for thrusting and a back spike is 
fitted for punching through armor. Some- 
times this spike is replaced by a sharpened 
hook for dismounting riders. 

Halberd: After the awl pike and the bill, 
this was one of the most popular weapons of 


74 


the Middle Ages. Fixed on a shaft five to 
eight feet long is a large axe blade, angled 
for maximum impact. The end of the blade 
tapers to a long spear point or awl pike. On 
the back is a hook for attacking armor or 
dismounting riders. Originally intended to 
defeat cavalry, it is not tremendously suc- 
cessful in that role since it lacks the reach of 
the pike and needs considerable room to 
swing. It found new life against blocks of 
pikemen. Should the advance of the main 
attack stall, halberdiers issue out of the for- 
mation and attack the flanks of the enemy. 
The pikemen with their overlong weapons 
are nearly defenseless in such close combat. 

Hook fauchard: This combination weap- 
on is another attempted improvement to the 
fauchard. A back hook is fitted to the back 
of the blade, supposedly to dismount horse- 
men. Like the fauchard, this is not a tremen- 
dously successful weapon. 

Lucern hammer: This weapon is similar to 
the bec de corbin. Fitted with a shaft up to 
ten feet long, it is usually found in the hands 
of the common soldier. Like the bec de cor- 
bin, its main purpose is to punch through 
armor. The end is fitted with the long point 
of an awl pike to hold off enemy cavalry. 

Military fork: This is one of the simplest 
modifications of a peasant’s tool since it is 
little more than a pitchfork fixed to a longer 
shaft. With tines strengthened and straight- 
ened, the military fork serves well. The need 
for cutting and cleaving eventually often 
results in combining the fork with other 
weapons. 

Partisan: Shorter than the awl pike but 
longer than the spear, the partisan is a broad 
spear-head mounted on an eight-foot-long 
shaft. Two smaller blades project out from 
the base of the main blade, just to increase 
damage and trap weapons. Since it is a 
thrusting weapon, it can be used in closely 
packed formations, 

Ranseur: Very much like the partisan, the 
ranseur differs in that the main blade is thin- 
ner and the projecting blades extended more 
like tines of a fork. These can trap a weapon 
and sometimes punch through armor. 

Spetum: The spetum is a modification of 
the normal spear. The shaft increases to 
eight to ten feet and side blades are added. 
Some have blades that angle back, increas- 
ing the damage when pulling the weapon 
out of a wound. These blades can also trap 
and block weapons or catch and hold an 
opponent. 

Voulge: The voulge, like the bardiche, is a 
variation on the axe and the cleaver. The 
voulge is little more than a cleaver on the 
end of a long (seven- to eight-foot) pole. It is 
a popular weapon, easy to make and simple 
to learn. It is also called the Lochaber axe. 


Scourge: This wicked weapon is a short 
whip with several thongs or tails. Each 
thong is studded with metal barbs, resulting 


in a terrible lash. It is sometimes used as an 
instrument of execution. 

Sword, Bastard: This sword is similar to a 
long sword in size and weight, but has a 
longer hilt. It can be used one- or two- 
handed. Use the speed factor and damage 
appropriate to the grip. If it is used two- 
handed, your character cannot employ a 
shield. 

Sword, Khopesh: This is an Egyptian 
weapon. A khopesh has about six inches of 
handle and quillons. Its blade is then 
straight from the quillons for about two 
feet. The blade becomes sickle-shaped at 
this point, being about two additional feet 
long but effectively extending the overall 
length of the sword by only 11/2 feet. This 
makes the khopesh both heavy and 
unwieldy, difficult to employ properly, and 
slow to recover, particularly after a badly 
missed blow. Its sickle-like portion can snag 
an opponent or an opposing weapon. 


Armor 


You are going to 
want your player character to buy armor, if 
he is allowed to use any. Armor is the easiest 
and cheapest way to improve your charac- 
ter’s chance of surviving the more violent 
dangers of the adventuring life. Clearly, the 
better the armor the character possesses, the 
less likely he is to be hurt. Armor protection 
is measured by Armor Class (AC), a number 
rating; the lower the Armor Class number, 
the better the protection. Table 46 lists the 
values for all the types of armor found in the 
equipment lists.

Note: See this page for more information 
on the defensive benefits of various shields. 


Although there is some controversy his- 
torically over the different types of armor, 
all known or suspected types are included 
here. However, not all armor may be availa- 


ble if your DM has chosen to set his cam- 
paign in a particular historical era or locale. 
For example, full plate armor is not availa- 
ble to characters adventuring in an ancient 
Greek setting. 

Banded: This armor is made of overlap- 
ping strips of metal sewn to a backing of 
leather and chain mail. Generally the strips 
cover only the more vulnerable areas, while 
the chain and leather protect the joints 
where freedom of movement must be 
ensured. Through straps and buckles, the 
weight is more or less evenly distributed. 

Brigandine: This armor is made from 
small metal plates sewn or riveted to a layer 
of canvas or leather and protected by an 
outer layer of cloth. It is rather stiff and does 
not provide adequate protection to the 
joints where the metal plates must be spaced 
widely or left off. 

Bronze plate mail: This is a plate mail 
armor—a combination of metal plates, 
chain mail or brigandine, leather and 
padding—made of softer bronze. It is easier 
and cheaper to make than steel armor, but it 
does not protect as well. A large breastplate 
and other metal plates cover areas of the 
body, but the other materials must protect 
the joints and movable parts of the body. It 
is not the full plate armor of the heavy 
knight of the Late Middle Ages and the Ren- 
aissance., 

Chain mail: This armor is made of inter- 
locking metal rings. It is always worn with a 
layer of quilted fabric padding underneath 
to prevent painful chafing and to cushion 
the impact of blows. Several layers of mail 
are normally hung over vital areas. The 
links yield easily to blows, absorbing some 
of the shock. Most of the weight of this 
armor is carried on the shoulders and it is 
uncomfortable to wear for long periods of 
time. 

Field plate armor: This is the most com- 
mon version of full plate armor, consisting 
of shaped and fitted metal plates riveted and 
interlocked to cover the entire body. It 
includes gauntlets, boots, and a visored hel- 
met. A thick layer of padding must be worn 
underneath. However, the weight of the suit 
is well-distributed over the whole body. 
Such armor hampers movement only slight- 
ly. Aside from its expense, the main disad- 
vantages are the lack of ventilation and the 
time required to put it on and take it off (see 
the “Getting Into and Out of Armor” sec- 
tion). Each suit of field plate must be indi- 
vidually fitted to its owner by a master 
armorer, although captured pieces can be 
resized to fit the new owner (unless such is 
patently absurd, such as a human trying to 
resize a halfling’s armor). 

Full Plate: This is the impressive, high 
Gothic-style armor of the Late Middle Ages 
and Renaissance. It is perfectly forged and 
fitted. All the plates are interlocking and 
carefully angled to deflect blows. The sur- 


75 


Equipment (Descriptions) 


faces are normally highly ornamented with 
etching and inlaid metals. Each suit must be 
carefully custom-fitted to the owner and 
there is only a 20% chance that a captured 
suit can be refitted to a new owner of 
approximately the same size. The metal 
plates are backed by padding and chain 
mail. The weight is well-distributed. The 
armor is hot, slow to don, and extremely 
expensive. Due to these factors, it tends to 
be used more for parades and triumphs than 
actual combat. 

Hide: This is armor prepared from the 
extremely thick hide of a creature (such as 
an elephant) or from multiple layers of regu- 
lar leather. It is stiff and hard to move in. 

Leather: This armor is made of leather 
hardened in boiling oil and then shaped into 
breastplate and shoulder protectors. The 
remainder of the suit is fashioned from more 
flexible, somewhat softer materials. 

Padded: This is the simplest type of 
armor, fashioned from quilted layers of 
cloth and batting. It tends to get hot and 
after a time becomes foul with sweat, grime, 
lice, and fleas. 

Plate mail: This armor is a combination 
of chain or brigandine with metal plates 
(curiass, epaulettes, elbow guards, gaunt- 
lets, tassets, and greaves) covering vital 
areas. The weight is distributed over the 
whole body and the whole thing is held 
together by buckles and straps. This is the 
most common form of heavy armor. 

Ring mail: This armor is an early (and less 
effective) form of chain mail in which metal 
rings are sewn directly to a leather backing 
instead of being interlaced. (Historians still 
debate whether this armor ever existed.) 

Scale mail: This is a coat and leggings 
(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather 
covered with overlapping pieces of metal, 
much like the scales of a fish. 

Shields: All shields improve a character's 
Armor Class by 1 or more against a speci- 
fied number of attacks. A shield is useful 
only to protect the front and flanks of the 
user. Attacks from the rear or rear flanks 
cannot be blocked by a shield (exception: a 
shield slung across the back does help 
defend against rear attacks). The reference 
to the size of the shield is relative to the size 
of the character. Thus a human’s small 
shield would have all the effects of a medi- 
um shield when used by a gnome. 

A buckler (or target) is a very small shield 
that fastens on the forearm. It can be worn 
by crossbowmen and archers with no hin- 
drance. Its small size enables it to protect 
against only one attack per melee round (of 
the user's choice), improving the character's 
Armor Class by 1 against that attack. 

A small shield is carried on the forearm 
and gripped with the hand. Its light weight 
permits the user to carry other items in that 
hand (although he cannot use weapons). It 
can be used to protect against two frontal 


<Q 


attacks of the user's choice. 

The medium shield is carried in the same 
manner as the small shield. Its weight pre- 
vents the character from using his shield 
hand for other purposes. With a medium 
shield, a character can protect against any 
frontal or flank attacks. 

The body shield is a massive shield reach- 
ing nearly from chin to toe. It must be firmly 
fastened to the forearm and the shield hand 
must grip it at all times. It provides a great 
deal of protection, improving the Armor 
Class of the character by 1 against melee 
attacks and by 2 against missile attacks, for 
attacks from the front or front flank sides. It 
is very heavy; the DM may wish to use the 
optional encumbrance system if he allows 
this shield. 

Splint Mail: The existence of this armor 
has been questioned. It is claimed that the 
armor is made of narrow vertical strips riv- 
eted to a backing of leather and cloth pad- 
ding. Since this is not flexible, the joints are 
protected by chain mail. 

Studded leather: This armor is made 
from leather (not hardened as with normal 
leather armor) reinforced with close-set 
metal rivets. In some ways it is very similar 
to brigandine, although the spacing 
between each metal piece is greater. 


In addition to the types of armor listed 
above, your DM may have special armors 
prepared from rare or exotic materials. 
Since it is highly unlikely that your charac- 
ter can afford these at the start, the DM will 
tell you when you need to know about such 
items. 


Armor Sizes 


The equipment list reflects the price of a 
suit of armor (including an appropriate hel- 
met) made for any normal player character 
race. Although a halfling is much smaller 
than a human and needs a smaller suit, there 
are fewer armorers available to meet such 
specialized needs. Thus the armor for a half- 
ling is as expensive as that for a human. 
Armor for nonstandard sizes and shapes is 
going to cost significantly more and must be 
custom-made. This is not the kind of thing 
one can pick up at the local store! 

When armor is found during the course of 
an adventure, the players should note the 
creature who wore the armor previously. 
While a human-sized character might be 
able to wear the armor of a gnoll, it will do 
little good for a halfling. Likewise, the 
armor of a giant is of little use to anyone. 

Armor size also affects the weight of the 
armor, if the optional encumbrance system 
is used. The weights listed on the table are 
for human-sized (Medium) armors. Small 
armor weighs half the amount listed, while 
large armor weighs 50% more. 


Getting Into and Out of Armor 


There are times when it is important to 
know how quickly a character can get into 
or out of his armor. Accidents and unfore- 
seen events happen all the time. The party is 
attacked at night. Those sleeping around the 
campfire may want to don their armor 
before rushing into battle. A character slips 
and falls into the river where his heavy 
armor pulls him down like a stone. He 
greatly desires to get it off before he drowns. 
Just how long does it take him? 

The time required to don armor depends 
on its make. Those armors that are a single 
piece—leather tunics, robes, chain mail— 
take one round (two for metal items) to don 
with slight assistance. Without aid, the time 
is doubled. Armor that is made of separate 
pieces requires 1d6 + 4 rounds, again with 
assistance. Without help, the time required 
is tripled. In all cases, the times given 
assume that the proper undergarments and 
padding are also worn. 

Sometimes characters need to get into 
armor ina hurry and thus they dress hastily. 
This assumes that some buckles aren’t fas- 
tened, seatings adjusted, etc. Single suits 
can be hastily donned in one round at the 


‘cost of 1 worse AC (though never worse 


than 8). Thus, a fighter could hastily pull on 
his brigandine jack (AC 6) and charge into a 
fray with an AC of 7. Hastily donning piece 
armor (plate mail for example) improves the 
character's AC by 1 (from a base of 10) for 
every round spent dressing. A fighter could 
choose to spend three rounds fitting on 
parts of his plate mail, giving him an AC of 
7, before going into battle. 

Removing armor is a much quicker matter. 
Most can be shed in a single round. Piece 
armor (particularly full plate) requires 1d4 + 
lLrounds. However, if the character is willing 
to cut straps and bend pins, such armors can 
be removed in half the time (roll 1d4+1, 
divide by 2, then round fractions up). 


Creatures with Natural Armor Classes 


Some creatures possess a natural Armor 
Class already superior to some of the armor 
types (for example, the horse is AC 7). 
However, these creatures can still benefit 
from wearing armor of a quality worse than 
their natural Armor Class. If the AC of 
armor is equal to or worse than the AC of 
the creature, the AC of the creature 
improves by 1. 

For example, a horse has a natural AC of 
7. The AC of leather armor is 8, worse than 
the horse's natural AC. However, if a horse 
is fitted with leather barding, its AC drops 
to 6 since it gains the benefit of the addition- 
al protection.

Basic Encumbrance 
(Tournament Rule) 


Encumbrance is 
divided into five categories: Unencum- 
bered, Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Se- 
vere Encumbrance. 

To calculate your character's encum- 
brance category, first figure out the total 
weight he is carrying (including five 
pounds for clothing). Then look across 
the row corresponding to your charac- 
ter’s Strength on Table 47 until you come 
to the column that includes your charac- 
ter’s carried weight. The heading at the 
top of that column shows his level of en- 
cumbrance 


Use Table 49 to figure out the encum- 
brance category of your character's 
mount or beast of burden. 

The Max. Carried Wgt. column lists 
the most weight (in pounds) your charac- 
ter can carry and still move. But move- 
ment is limited to 10 feet per round, as 
_ character staggers under the heavy 


Specific Encumbrance 
(Optional Rule) 


The maximum 
total weight yor character can carry is 
determined by his Strength, as listed on 
Table 47. 

The basic encumbrance rule gives gen- 
eral categories of encumbrance but does 
not allow for fine distinctions. Some 
players and DMs may take exception to 
the idea that adding one more pound toa 
character suddenly shifts that character 
to the next (and drastically worse) en- 
cumbrance category. They may want to 
use the following optional table; Table 48 
reduces a character's movement rating 1 
factor at a time. 

To determine your character's move- 
ment rate (see “Movement,” page 119) for 
a given load, find the row on Table 48 
with his Strength score. Read across it 
until you find the first column in which 
the number of pounds listed is greater 
than your character's current load. At 
the top of that column are two rows for 
base movement rates. Characters with a 
base movement rate of 12 use the top 
row; those with a base movement rate of 
6 use the bottom row. The number in the 
appropriate upper row is your charac- 
ter's modified movement rate. 


Tarus (a human with a base movement 
of 12) has a Strength of 17 and is carrying 
a 140-pound load. Looking across on the 
17 row shows that 140 falls between 133 
and 145 on the table. Looking at the top

Aside from knowing the weight limits,

pounds) and maintain his speed, or drop 
seven pounds of equipment (to 133 
pounds) and increase his speed to 8. 


Encumbrance and Mounts 
(Tournament Rule) 


The “Base Move” 
column in Table 49 lists the maximum 
amount an animal can carry and main- 
tain its normal movement rate. Animals 
can be loaded greater than this, up to a 
maximum of twice their normal load. 
However, this causes a drop in the ani- 
mal’s movement rate (as indicated by the 
column headings). When calculating a 
mount's load, be sure to include the 
weight of the rider! 

The values listed in Table 50 are for 
standard-sized items. It is certainly pos- 
sible for sacks, chests, and backpacks to 
be larger or smaller than the sizes listed. 
The weight capacity, however, lists the 
maximum weight the item can carry, 
regardless of size. Beyond this point, the 
material used to construct the item will 
fail, sooner or later. The volume gives 
the length, width, and height or depth of 
the item. Items that exceed the capacity 
of a container cannot be stored in it. 

Since all player characters are adven- 
turers, it is assumed they know the best 
methods for packing and stowing equip- 
ment. Blankets are rolled into bedrolls, 
small items are carefully arranged, rope 
is properly coiled, weapons are slung in 
the most comfortable manner, etc. While 
small items can be easily stuffed into a 
pack, large bulky things may encumber 


— 


more than their actual weight would 
indicate. The DM has the right to rule 
that an object is more encumbering than 
it actually appears. 


For example, Tarus Bloodheart finds a 
5’ X 9! flying carpet. He carefully rolls it 
into a thick cylinder and wisely ties it 
closed. Even though he has taken this 
sensible precaution, the carpet is still a 
large and awkward thing. The DM rules 
that although the carpet weighs only 20 
pounds, its encumbrance is equal to that 
of an item weighing 50 pounds. Tarus 
must increase his current encumbrance 
level by 50 pounds, adding the awk- 
wardness of the rolled carpet slung over 
his shoulder to his already carefully 
packed backpack. 


Magical Armor and Encumbrance 


One of the spe- 
cial properties of magical armor is its 
effect on encumbrance. Although magi- 
cal armor appears to weigh as much as 
normal armor, the weight of magical 
armor applies only toward the weight 
limit of the character. It does not apply 
when determining the effects of encum- 
brance on movement and combat. In 
essence, the armor appears to weigh as 
much as normal armor but does not 
restrict or hamper the character, 


For example, Cwell the bard finds a 
suit of chain mail +1. Lifting it up, he 
finds it weighs 60 pounds. Cwell is 
already carrying 50 pounds of gear. Don- 
ning the chain mail, he is now carrying 
110 lbs. of gear. Cwell’s Strength is 12, 
which means that he can carry only 30 


79 


-P 


more pounds of equipment. However, 
when calculating the effect of all this 
weight on his movement, Cwell is consid- 
ered to only be carrying 50 pounds of 
gear—the magical armor doesn't count. 
Furthermore, he does not suffer any com- 
bat penalties for the chain mail’s weight. 


Effects of Encumbrance 


Encumbrance 
has two basic effects. First, it reduces 
your character's movement rate. If 
encumbrance categories are used, Unen- 
cumbered has no effect on movement, 
Light reduces the movement rate by 2/3 
(round fractions down), Moderate 
reduces it by */2, Heavy reduces it by 2/s, 
and Severe lowers the movement rate to 
1. If the optional system is used, the 
character's movement rate is reduced to 
the amount found by using Table 48. The 
movement rate determines how far your 
character can move in a round, turn, 
hour, and day. As his movement rate gets 
lower, your character moves slower and 
slower. See “Movement,” on page 119, 
for more details. 

Encumbrance also reduces your char- 
acter’s combat abilities. If encumbrance 
reduces your character to 1/2 of his nor- 
mal movement rate, he suffers a —1 pen- 
alty to his attack roll. If he is reduced to 
1/3 or less of his normal movement rate, 
the attack penalty is —2 and there is an 
additional AC penalty of +1. If your 
character's movement is reduced to 1, the 
attack roll penalty is — 4 and the AC pen- 
alty is +3. Clearly, the wise thing for a 
heavily encumbered character to do is to 
quickly drop most of his gear before 
entering battle. 


Chapter7:Magic ~~ 


Some of the most powerful weapons player 
characters have at their disposal in the 
AD&D® game are magical spells. Through 
spells a player character can control earth- 
quakes, call lightning out of the sky, heal 
grievous injuries, hurl explosive balls of 
fire, create barriers of stone, fire, and ice, 
and learn secrets long forgotten. These are 
only a few of the things player characters 
can do once they master the strange lore of 
spells. 

Not every character is capable of casting 
spells, however. This ability requires a cer- 
tain amount of aptitude, depending on the 
type of spells cast. Wizard spells are best 
mastered by those with keen intelligence 
and patience for the long years of study that 
are required. Priest spells call for inner 
peace and faith and an intense devotion to 
one’s calling. 

The vast majority of people in a fantasy 
campaign lack these traits or have never had 
the opportunity to develop them. The baker 
may be a bright and clever fellow, but, fol- 
lowing in his father’s footsteps, he has spent 
his life learning the arts of bread making. 
There has simply been no time in his life for 
the study of old books and crumbling 
scrolls. The hard-working peasant may be 
pious and upright in his faith, but he lacks 
the time for the contemplative and scholarly 
training required of a priest. So it is only a 
fortunate few who have the ability and 


opportunity to learn the arcane lore of 
spellcasting. 

A few character classes have a limited 
ability to cast spells. The ranger, through his 
close association with nature, is able to cast 
a few spells, though his choices are limited 
to his natural inclinations. The paladin, 
through his devotion and humility, can use 
some of the spells of the priest. The bard, 
through luck, happenstance, curiosity, and 
perseverance, can manage a few wizard 
spells, perhaps by persuading a lonely mage 
to reveal his secrets. 

Regardless of their source, all spells fall 
into the general categories of wizard or 
priest. Although some spells appear in both 
categories, in general the categories differ in 
how spells are acquired, stored, and cast. 


Wizard Spells 


Wizard spells range 
from spells of simple utility to great and 
powerful magics. The wizard spell group 
has no single theme or purpose. The vast 
majority of wizard spells were created by 
ancient mages for many different purposes. 
Some are to serve the common man in his 
everyday needs. Others provide adventur- 
ers with the might and firepower they need 
to survive. Some are relatively simple and 
safe to use (as safe as magic can be); others 
are complicated, filled with hazards and 


snares for the rash and unwary. Perhaps the 
greatest of all wizard spells is the powerful 
and tricky wish. It represents the epitome of 
spell-casting—causing things to happen 
simply because the mage desires it to be so. 
But it is a long and difficult task to attain the 
mastery needed to learn this spell. 

Although some characters can use spells, 
the workings of magic are dimly understood 
at best. There are many theories about 
where the power comes from. The most 
commonly accepted idea is that the mysteri- 
ous combination of words, gestures, and 
materials that make up a spell somehow 
taps an extradimensional source of energy 
that in turn causes the desired effect. Some- 
how the components of the spells—those 
words, gestures and materials—route this 
energy to a specific and desired result. For- 
tunately, how this happens is not very 
important to the majority of wizards. It is 
enough to know that “when you do this, 
that happens.” 

Casting a wizard spell is a very compli- 
cated ordeal. The process of learning the 
correct procedure to cast a spell is difficult 
and taxing to the mind. Thus a wizard must 
check to see if he learns each new spell 
(according to his Intelligence—see Table 4). 
Furthermore, there is a limit to just how 
much of this strangeness—illogical mathe- 
matics, alchemical chemistry, structuralist 
linguistics—a wizard’s mind can compre- 


Magic (Schools) 


hend, and so he must also live with a limit to 
the number of spells he can know. 

As the wizard learns spells, he records 
their arcane notes into his spell books. 
Without spell books, a wizard cannot mem- 
orize new spells. Within them are all his 
instructions for memorizing and casting all 
the spells he knows. As the wizard success- 
fully learns a new spell, he carefully enters 
its formula into his spell books. A wizard 
can never have a spell in his books that he 
does not know, because if he doesn’t under- 
stand it, he cannot write the formula. Like- 
wise, he cannot enter a spell into his books 
that is higher in level than he can cast. If he 
finds an ancient tome with spells of higher 
power, he must simply wait until he 
advances to a level at which he can use 
them. 

The exact shape and size of a character's 
spell books is a detail your DM will provide. 
They may be thick tomes of carefully inked 
parchment, crackling scrolls in bulky cases, 
or even weighty clay tablets. They are 
almost never convenient to carry around. 
Their exact form depends on the type and 
setting of the campaign world your DM has 
created. 

Ultimately, it is the memorization that is 
important. To draw on magical energy, the 
wizard must shape specific mental patterns 
in his mind. He uses his spell books to force 
his mind through mental exercises, prepar- 
ing it to hold the final, twisted patterns. 
These patterns are very complicated and 
alien to normal thought, so they don’t regis- 
ter in the mind as normal learning. To shape 
these patterns, the wizard must spend time 
memorizing the spell, twisting his thoughts 
and recasting the energy patterns each time 
to account for subtle changes—planetary 
motions, seasons, time of day, and more. 

Once a wizard memorizes a spell, it 
remains in his memory (as potential energy) 
until he uses the prescribed components to 
trigger the release of the energy patterns. 
The mental patterns apparently release the 
energy while the components shape and 
guide it. Upon casting, the energy of the 
spell is spent, wiped clean from the wizard’s 
mind. The mental patterns are lost until the 
wizard studies and memorizes that spell 
again. 

The number of spells a wizard can memo- 
rize is given by his level (see Table 21); he 
can memorize the same spell more than 
once, but each memorization counts as one 
spell toward his daily memorization limit. 
Part of a wizard’s intelligence can be seen in 
the careful selection of spells he has memo- 
rized 


Memorization is not a thing that happens 
immediately. The wizard must have a clear 
head gained from a restful night's sleep and 
then has to spend time studying his spell 
books. The amount of study time needed is 
10 minutes per level of the spell being mem- 


orized. Thus, a 9th-level spell (the most 
powerful) would require 90 minutes of care- 
ful study, Clearly, high-level spellcasters do 
not lightly change their memorized spells. 
Spells remain memorized until they are 
cast or wiped from the character's mind by a 
spell or magical item. A wizard cannot 
choose to forget a memorized spell to 
replace it with another one. He can, how- 
ever, cast a spell just to cleanse his mind for 
another spell. (The DM must make sure that 
the wizard does not get experience for this.) 


Schools of Magic 


Although all wiz- 
ard spells are learned and memorized the 
same way, they fall into nine different 
schools of magic. A school of magic is a 
group of related spells. 

Abjuration spells are a group of special- 
ized protective spells. Each is used to pre- 
vent or banish some magical or nonmagical 
effect or creature. They are often used to 
provide safety in times of great danger or 
when attempting some other particularly 
dangerous spell. 

Alteration spells cause a change in the 
properties of some already existing thing, 
creature, or condition. This is accomplished 
by magical energy channeled through the 
wizard 


Conjuration/summoning spells bring 
something to the caster from elsewhere. 
Conjuration normally produces matter or 
items from some other place. Summoning 
enables the caster to compel living creatures 
and powers to appear in his presence or to 
channel extraplanar energies through him- 
self. 

Enchantment/charm spells cause a 
change in the quality of an item or the atti- 
tude of a person or creature. Enchantments 
can bestow magical properties on ordinary 
items, while can unduly influence 
the behavior of beings. 

Greater divinations are more powerful 
than lesser divinations (see below). These 
spells enable the wizard to learn secrets long 
forgotten, to predict the future, and to 
uncover things hidden or cloaked by spells. 

Illusions deal with spells to deceive the 
senses or minds of others. Spells that cause 
people to see things that are not there, hear 
noises not made, or remember things that 
never happened are all illusions. 

Invocation/Evocation spells channel 
magical energy to create specific effects and 
materials. Invocation normally relies on the 
intervention of some higher agency (to 
whom the spell is addressed), while evoca- 
tion enables the caster to directly shape the 
energy. 

Lesser divination spells are learnable by 
all wizards, regardless of their affiliation. 
This school includes the most basic and vital 
spells of the wizard—those he needs to prac- 


tice other aspects of his craft. Lesser divina- 
tions include read magic and detect magic. 

Necromancy is one of the most restrictive 
of all spell schools. It deals with dead things 
or the restoration of life, limbs, or vitality to 
living creatures. Although a small school, 
its spells tend to be powerful. Given the 
risks of the adventuring world, necromantic 
spells are considered quite useful. 


Learning Spells 


Whether a charac- 
ter chooses to be a mage or a specialist in 
one of the schools of magic, he must learn 
his spells from somewhere. While it might 
be possible for the exceptional wizard to 
learn the secrets of arcane lore entirely on 
his own, it isn’t very likely. It is far more 
likely that your character was apprenticed 
to another wizard as a lad. This kindly 
(severe), loving (callous), understanding 
(ill-tempered), generous (mean-spirited), 
and upright (untrustworthy) master taught 
your character everything he knows at the 
start of the game. Then, when it was time, 
the master sent him into the world (threw 
him out) with a smile and a pat on the back 
(snarling with his foot on your character's 
behind). 

Or perhaps your character studied at a 
proper academy for wizards (if your DM 
has such things). There he completed his les- 
sons under the eye of a firm (mean) but 
patient (irritable) tutor who was ready with 
praise for good work (a cane for the slightest 
fault). But alas, your character's parents 
were impoverished and his studies had to 
end (fed up with this treatment, your youth- 
ful character fled during the night). 

As you can see, there are a number of 
ways your character might have learned his 
spells. 

The one good thing that comes from your 
character's studies is his initial spell book. It 
may have been a gift from his school or he 
may have stolen it from his hated master. 
Whatever the case, your character begins 
play with a spell book containing up to a 
few 1st-level spells. Your DM will tell you 
the exact number of spells and which spells 
they are. As your character adventures, he 
will have the opportunity to add more spells 
to his collection. 

When your character attains a new level, 
he may or may not receive new spells. This 
is up to your DM. He may allow your char- 
acter to return to his mentor (provided he 
departed on good terms!) and add a few 
spells to his book. It may be possible for 
your character to copy spells from the spell 
book of another player character (with his 
permission, of course). Or he may have to 
wait until he can find a spell book with new 
spells, How he gets his spells is one of the 
things your DM decides. 

In all cases, before he can add a new spell 


to his spell book, you have to check to see if 
your character learns that spell. The chance 
of learning a spell depends on your wizard’s 
Intelligence, as given in Table 4. This chance 
may be raised or lowered if your character is 
a specialist. 


Illusions 


Of all spells, those 
of the illusion school cause the most prob- 
lems. Not that they are more difficult for 
your player character to cast, but these 
spells are more difficult for you to role-play 
and for your DM to adjudicate. Illusions 


—s 


/, 


(a 


KAO 


rely on the idea of believability, which in 
turn relies on the situation and the state of 
mind of the victim. Your DM must deter- 
mine this for NPCs, which is perhaps an eas- 
ier job, You must role-play this for your 
character. 

Spells of this school fall into two basic 
groups. Illusions are creations that manipu- 
late light, color, shadow, sound, and some- 
times even scent. Higher level illusions tap 
energy from other planes, and are actually 
quasi-real, being woven of extradimen- 
sional energies by the caster. Common illu- 
sions create appearances; they cannot make 
a creature or object look like nothing (i.e., 
invisible), but they can conceal objects by 
making them look like something else. 

Phantasms exist only in the minds of their 
victims; these spells are never even quasi- 
real. (The exceptions to this are the phantas- 
mal force spells, which are actually illusions 
rather than phantasms.) Phantasms act 
upon the mind of the victim to create an 
intense reaction—fear being most common. 

The key to successful illusions or phan- 
tasms is believability, which depends on 
three main factors: what the caster 
attempts, what the victim expects, and what 
is happening at the moment the spell is cast. 
By combining the information from these 
three areas, the player and the DM should 
be able to create and adjudicate reasonable 
illusions and phantasms. 

When casting an illusion or phantasm, 
the caster can attempt to do anything he 
desires within the physical limits of the 
spell. Prior knowledge of the illusion cre- 
ated is not necessary but is extremely useful. 

For example, suppose Delsenora decides to 
cast a phantasmal force spell and can choose 
between creating the image of a troll (a crea- 
ture she has seen and battled) or that of a 
beholder (a creature she has never seen but 
has heard terrifying descriptions of). She can 
either use her memory to create a realistic 
troll or use her imagination to create some- 
thing that may or may not look like a real 
beholder. The troll, based on her first-hand 
knowledge of these creatures, is going to 
have lots of little details—a big nose, warts, 
green, scabby skin, and even a shambling 
troll-like walk. Her illusion of a beholder will 
be much less precise, just a floating ball with 
one big eye and eyestalks. She doesn't know 
its color, size, or behavior. 

The type of image chosen by the caster 
affects the reaction of the victim. If the vic- 
tim in the above case has seen both a troll 
and a beholder, which will be more believ- 
able? Almost certainly it will be the troll, 
which looks and acts the way the victim 
thinks a troll should. He might not even rec- 
ognize the other creature as a beholder since 
it doesn’t look like any beholder he’s ever 
seen. Even if the victim has never seen a troll 
or a beholder, the troll will still be more 
believable; it acts in a realistic manner, 


82 


while the beholder does not. Thus spellcast- 
ers are well-advised to create images of 
things they have seen, for the same reason 
authors are advised to write about things 
they know. 

The next important consideration is to 
ask if the spell creates something that the 
victim expects. Which of these two illusions 
would be more believable—a huge dragon 
rising up behind a rank of attacking kobolds 
(puny little creatures) or a few ogres form- 
ing a line behind the kobolds? Most adven- 
turers would find it hard to believe that a 
dragon would be working with kobolds. 
The dragon is far too powerful to associate 
with such little shrimps. Ogres, however, 
could very well work with kobolds— 
bossing them around and using them as can- 
non fodder. The key to a good illusion is to 
create something the victim does not expect 
but can quickly accept. 

The most believable illusion may be that 
of a solid wall in a dungeon, transforming a 
passage into a dead end. Unless the victim is 
familiar with these hallways, he has no rea- 
son not to believe that the wall is there. 

Of course, in a fantasy world many more 
things can be believed than in the real 
world. Flames do not spring out of nowhere 
in the real world, but this can happen in a 
fantasy world. The presence of magic in a 
fantasy world makes victims more willing 
to accept things our logic tells us cannot 
happen. A creature appearing out of 
nowhere could be an illusion or it could be 
summoned. At the same time, you must 
remember that a properly role-played char- 
acter is familiar with the laws of his world. 
If a wall of flames appears out of nowhere, 
he will look for the spellcaster. A wall 
blocking a corridor may cause him to check 
for secret doors. If the illusion doesn’t con- 
form to his idea of how things work, the 
character should become suspicious. This is 
something you have to provide for your 
character and something you must remem- 
ber when your character attempts to use 
illusions. 

This then leads to the third factor in the 
believability of an illusion, how appropriate 
the illusion is for the situation. As men- 
tioned before, the victim is going to have 
certain expectations about any given 
encounter. The best illusions reinforce these 
expectations to your character's advantage. 
Imagine that your group runs into a war 
party of orcs in the local forest. What could 
you do that would reinforce what the orcs 
might already believe? They see your 
group, armed and ready for battle. They do 
not know if you are alone or are the advance 
guard for a bigger troop. A good illusion 
could be the glint of metal and spear points 
coming up behind your party. Subtlety has 
its uses. The orcs will likely interpret your 
illusion as reinforcements to your group, 
enough to discourage them from attacking. 


Magic (Priest Spells) 


However, the limitations of each spell 
must be considered when judging appropri- 
ateness. A phantasmal force spell creates 
vision only. It does not provide sound, light, 
or heat. In the preceding situation, creating 
a troop of soldiers galloping up behind you 
would not have been believable. Where is 
the thunder of hooves, the creak of saddle 
leather, the shouts of your allies, the clank 
of drawn metal, or the whinny of horses? 
Orcs may not be tremendously bright, but 
they are not fooled that easily. Likewise, a 
dragon that suddenly appears without a 
thunderous roar and dragonish stench isn’t 
likely to be accepted as real. A wise spell- 
caster always considers the limitations of his 
illusions and finds ways to hide their weak- 
nesses from the enemy. 

An illusion spell, therefore, depends on 
its believability. Believability is determined 
by the situation and a saving throw, Under 
normal circumstances, those observing the 
illusion are allowed a saving throw vs. spell 
if they actively disbelieve the illusion. For 
player characters, disbelieving is an action 
in itself and takes a round. For NPCs and 
monsters, a normal saving throw is made if 
the DM deems it appropriate. The DM can 
give bonuses or penalties to this saving 
throw as he thinks appropriate. If the caster 
has cleverly prepared a realistic illusion, this 
certainly results in penalties on the victim's 
saving throw. If the victim were to rely 
more on scent than sight, on the other hand, 
it could gain bonuses to its saving throw. If 
the saving throw is passed, the victim sees 
the illusion for what it is. If the saving throw 
is failed, the victim believes the illusion. A 
good indication of when player characters 
should receive a positive modifier to their 
saving throws is when they say they don’t 
believe what they see, especially if they can 
give reasons why. 

There are rare instances when the saving 
throw may automatically succeed or fail. 
There are times when the illusion created is 
either so perfect or so utterly fantastic as to 
be impossible even in a fantasy world. Be 
warned, these occasions are very rare and 
you should not expect your characters to 
benefit from them more than once or twice. 

In many encounters, some party mem- 
bers will believe an illusion while others see 
it for what it really is. In these cases, reveal- 
ing the truth to those deluded by the spell is 
not a simple matter of telling them. The 
magic of the spell has seized their minds. 
Considered from their point of view, they 
see a horrible monster (or whatever) while a 
friend is telling them it isn’t real. They know 
magic can affect people's minds, but whose 
mind has been affected in this case? At best, 
having an illusion pointed out grants 
another saving throw with a +4 bonus. 

Illusions do have other limitations. The 
caster must maintain a show of reality at all 
times when conducting an illusion. (If a 


squad of low-level fighters is created, the 
caster dictates their hits, misses, damage 
inflicted, apparent wounds, and so forth, 
and the referee decides whether the bounds 
of believability have been exceeded.) Main- 
taining an illusion normally requires con- 
centration on the part of the caster, 
preventing him from doing other things. 
Disturb him and the illusion vanishes. 

Illusions are spells of trickery and deceit, 
not damage and destruction. Thus, illusions 
cannot be used to cause real damage. When 
a creature is caught in the blast of an illu- 
sionary fireball or struck by the claws of an 
illusionary troll, he thinks he takes damage. 
The DM should record the illusionary dam- 
age (but tell the player his character has tak- 
en real damage). If the character takes 
enough damage to “die,” he collapses in a 
faint. A system shock roll should be made 
for the character. (His mind, believing the 
damage to be real, may cause his body to 
cease functioning!) If the character survives, 
he regains consciousness after 1d3 turns 
with his illusionary damage healed. In most 
cases, the character quickly realizes that it 
was all an illusion. 

When an illusion creates a situation of 
inescapable death, such as a giant block 
dropping from the ceiling, all those believ- 
ing the illusion must roll for system shock. If 
they fail, they die—killed by the sheer terror 
of the situation. If they pass, they are 
allowed a new saving throw with a +4 
bonus. Those who pass recognize the illu- 
sion for what it is. Those who fail faint for 
1d3 turns. 

Illusions do not enable characters to defy 
normal physical laws. A illusionary bridge 
cannot support a character who steps on it, 
even if he believes the bridge is real. A illu- 
sionary wall does not actually cause a rock 
thrown at it to bounce off. However, affect- 
ed creatures attempt to simulate the reality 
of what they see as much as possible. A 
character who falls into an illusionary pit 
drops to the ground as if he had fallen. A 
character may lean against an illusionary 
wall, not realizing that he isn’t actually put- 
ting his weight on it. If the same character 
were suddenly pushed, he would find him- 
self falling through the very wall he thought 
was solid! 

Illusions of creatures do not automati- 
cally behave like those creatures, nor do 
they have those creatures’ powers. This 
depends on the caster's ability and the vic- 
tim's knowledge of the creatures. Illusion- 
ary creatures fight using the caster’s combat 
ability. They take damage and die when 
their caster dictates it. An illusory orc could 
continue to fight, showing no damage, even 
after it had been struck a hundred or a thou- 
sand times. Of course, long before this its 
attackers will become suspicious. Illusion- 
ary creatures can have whatever special 
abilities the caster can make appear (i.e., a 


84 


dragon's fiery breath or a troll’s regenera- 
tion), but they do not necessarily have 
unseen special abilities. There is no way a 
caster can create the illusion of a basilisk’s 
gaze that turns people to stone. However, 
these abilities might be manifested through 
the fears of the victims. For example, Rath 
the fighter meets an illusionary basilisk. 
Rath has fought these beasties before and 
knows what they can do. His gaze acciden- 
tally locks with that of the basilisk. Primed 
by his own fears, Rath must make a system 
shock roll to remain alive. But if Rath had 
never seen a basilisk and had no idea that 
the creature's gaze could turn him to stone, 
there is no way his mind could generate the 
fear necessary to kill him. Sometimes igno- 
rance is bliss! 


Priest Spells 


The spells of a 
priest, while sometimes having powers simi- 
lar to those of the wizard, are quite different 
in their overall tone. The priest's role, more 
often than not, is as defender and guide for 
others. Thus the majority of his spells work 
to aid others or provide some service to the 
community in which he lives. Few of his 
spells are truly offensive, but many can be 
used cleverly to protect or defend. 

Like the wizard, the priest's level deter- 
mines how many spells he retains. He must 
select these spells in advance, demonstrat- 
ing his wisdom and far-sightedness by 
choosing those spells he thinks will be most 
useful in the trials that lurk ahead. 

Unlike the wizard, the priest needs no 
spell book and does not roll to see if he 
learns spells. Priest spells are obtained in an 
entirely different manner. To obtain his 
spells, a priest must be faithful to the cause 
of his deity. If the priest feels confident in 
this (and most do), he can pray for his 
spells. Through prayer, the priest humbly 
and politely requests those spells he wishes 
to memorize. Under normal circumstances, 
these spells are then granted. 

A priest's spell selection is limited by his 
level and by the different spheres of spells. 
(The spheres of influence, into which priest 
spells are divided, can be found on page 34.) 
Within the major spheres of his deity, a 
priest can use any spell of a given level when 
he is able to cast spells of that level. Thus, a 
druid is able to cast any 2nd-level plant 
sphere spells when he is able to cast 2nd- 
level spells. For spells belonging to the 
minor spheres of the priest's deity, he can 
cast spells only up to 3rd level. The knowl- 
edge of what spells are available to the priest 
becomes instantly clear as soon as he 
advances in level. This, too, is bestowed by 
his deity. 

Priests must pray to obtain spells, as they 
are requesting their abilities from some 
greater power, be it their deity or some 


Magic (Casting Spells) 


intermediary agent of this power. The con- 
ditions for praying are identical to those 
needed for the wizard’s studying. Clearly 
then, it behooves the priest to maintain him- 
self in good standing with this power, 
through word and deed. Priests who slip in 
their duties, harbor indiscreet thoughts, or 
neglect their beliefs, find that their deity has 
an immediate method of redress. If the 
priest has failed in his duties, the deity can 
deny him spells as a clear message of dissat- 
isfaction. For minor infractions, the deity 
can deny minor spells. Major failings result 
in the denial of major spells or, even worse, 
all spells. These can be regained if the char- 
acter immediately begins to make amends 
for his errors. Perhaps the character only 
needs to be a little more vigilant, in the case 
of a minor fault. A serious transgression 
could require special service, such as a quest 
or some great sacrifice of goods. These are 
things your DM will decide, should your 
character veer from the straight and narrow 
path of his religion. 

Finally, your DM may rule that not all 
deities are equal, so that those of lesser 
power are unable to grant certain spells. If 
this optional rule is used, powers of demi- 
god status can only grant spells up to the Sth 
spell level. Lesser deities can grant 6th-level 
spells, while the greater deities have all spell 
levels available to them. You should inquire 
about this at the time you create your char- 
acter (and decide which deity he worships), 
to prevent any unwelcome surprises later 
on. 


Casting Spells 


Both wizards and 
priests use the same rules for casting spells. 
To cast a spell, the character must first have 
the spell memorized. If it is not memorized, 
the spell cannot be cast. The caster must be 
able to speak (not under the effects of a 
silence spell or gagged) and have both arms 
free. (Note that the optional spell compo- 
nent rule [following section] can modify 
these conditions.) If the spell is targeted on a 
person, place, or thing, the caster must be 
able to see the target. It is not enough to cast 
a fireball 150 feet ahead into the darkness; 
the caster must be able to see the point of 
explosion and the intervening distance. 
Likewise, a magic missile (which always hits 
its target) cannot be fired into a group of 
bandits with the instruction to strike the 
leader; the caster must be able to identify 
and see the leader. 

Once the casting has begun, the character 
must stand still. Casting cannot be accom- 
plished while riding a roughly moving beast 
or a vehicle, unless special efforts are made 
to stabilize and protect the caster. Thus a 
spell cannot be cast from the back of a gal- 
loping horse under any conditions, nor can 
a wizard or priest cast a spell on the deck of 


a ship during a storm. However, if the caster 
were below decks, protected from the wind 
and surging waves, he could cast a spell. 
While it is not normally possible to cast a 
spell from a moving chariot, a character 
who was steadied and supported by others 
could do so. Your DM will have to make a 
ruling in these types of extraordinary condi- 
tions. 

During the round in which the spell is 
cast, the caster cannot move to dodge 
attacks. Therefore, no AC benefit from 
Dexterity is gained by spellcasters while 
casting spells. Furthermore, if the spellcast- 
er is struck by a weapon or fails to make a 
saving throw before the spell is cast, the 
caster’s concentration is disrupted. The spell 
is lost in a fizzle of useless energy and is 
wiped clean from the memory of the caster 
until it can be rememorized. Spellcasters are 
well advised not to stand at the front of any 
battle, at least if they want to be able to cast 
any spells!

Spell Components 
(Optional Rule) 


When your char- 
acter casts a spell, it is assumed that he is 
doing something to activate that spell. 
He may utter a few words, wave his 
hand around a couple of times, wiggle 
his toes, swallow a live spider, etc. But, 
under the standard rules, you don’t have 
to know exactly what he does to activate 
the spell. Some of this can be answered if 
your DM uses the rules for spell compo- 
nents. 

The actions required to cast a spell are 
divided into three groups: verbal, 
somatic (gestures), and material. Each 
spell description (starting on page 131) 
lists what combination of these compo- 
nents is needed to cast a spell. Verbal 
components require the caster to speak 
clearly (not be silenced in any way); 


Magic (Magical Research) 


held); material components must be 


of play, it is best to assume that any spell- 
caster with any sense has a supply of the 
common items he is likely to need—wax, 
feathers, paint, sand, sticks, and fluff, 
for example. For expensive and rare 
items, it is perfectly proper for your DM 
to insist that special efforts be made to 


cannot assume your character has a 
valuable pearl handy whenever he needs 
one! 

The three different aspects of spell 
components also change the conditions 
under which your character can cast his 
spells. No longer does he need to be able 
to speak, move, and use some item. He 
only needs to fulfill the required compo- 
nents, Thus a spell with only a verbal 
component could be used by a naked, 
bound spellcaster. One requiring only 
gestures could be cast even within the 
radius of a silence spell. Most spells 
require a combination of components, 
but clever spellcasters often create new 
spells that need only a word or a gesture, 
enabling them to take their enemies by 
surprise. 


Magical Research 


One oft-ignored as- 
set of both wizards and priests is magical 
research. While the spell lists for both 
groups offer a wide variety of tools and 
effects, the clever player character can 
quickly get an edge by researching his own 
spells. Where other spellcasters may fall 
quickly into tired and predictable patterns 
(“Look, it's a mage! Get ready for the fire- 
ball, guys!”), an enterprising character can 
deliver sudden (and nasty) surprises! 

Although your DM has the rules for han- 
dling spell research, there are some things 
you should know about how to proceed. 
First and foremost, research means that you 


and your DM will be working together to 
expand the game. This is not a job he does 
for you! Without your input, nothing hap- 
pens. Second, whatever your character 
researches, it cannot be more powerful than 
the spells he is already able to cast. If it is, 
you must wait until your character can cast 
spells of an equal power. (Thus. as a Ist- 
level wizard, you cannot research a spell 
that is as powerful as a fireball. You must 
wait until your character can cast a fireball.) 
Finally, you will have to be patient and will- 
ing to have your character spend some 
money. He won't create the spell immedi- 
ately, as research takes time. It also takes 
money, so you can expect your DM to use 
this opportunity to relieve your character of 
some of that excess cash, But, after all, how 
better for a spellcaster to spend his money? 

Knowing these things, you should first 
write up a description of the spell you want 
to create. Be sure to include information on 
components, saving throws, range, dura- 
tion, and all the other entries you find in the 
normal spell listings. When you give your 
DM the written description, tell him what 
you want the spell to do. (Sometimes what 
you write isn’t really what you mean, and 
talking to your DM is a good way to prevent 
confusion.) After this, he will either accept 
or reject your spell. This is his choice and 
not all DMs will have the same answer. 
Don't kick and complain; find out what 
changes are needed to make the spell accept- 
able. You can probably iron out the differ- 
ences. 

Once all these things are done, your char- 
acter can research the spell. Be ready for this 
to take some time. Eventually he will suc- 
ceed, although the spell may not do quite 
what he expected. Your DM may revise the 
spell, perhaps reducing the area of effect or 
damage inflicted. Finally, all you have to do 
is name your spell. This should be some- 
thing suitably pompous, such as “Del- 
senora’s Malevolent Steamroller.” After all, 
you want something to impress the locals! 


Spell Descriptions 


The spells are orga- 
nized according to their group (priest or 
wizard) and level, starting on page 131. 
Within each level, the spells are arranged 
alphabetically. At the start of each spell 
description is the following important game 
information: 

Name: Each spell is identified by name. In 
parentheses after the name is the school (for 
wizard spells) to which that spell belongs. 
When more than one is listed, that spell is 
common to all schools given. 

Some spells are reversible (they can be 
cast for an effect opposite to that of the 
standard spell). This is noted after the spell 
name. Priests with reversible spells must 
memorize the desired version. For example, 


86 


a priest who desires a cause light wounds 
spell must petition for this form of the cure 
light wounds spell when meditating and 
praying. Note that severe penalties can 
result if the spell choice is at variance with 
the priest's alignment (possible penalties 
include denial of specific spells, entire spell 
levels, or even all spells for a certain peri- 
od). The exact result (if any) depends on the 
reaction of the priest's patron deity, as deter- 
mined by the DM. 

Reversible wizard spells operate similarly. 
When the spell is learned, both forms are 
recorded in the wizard’s spell books. How- 
ever, the wizard must decide which version 
of the spell he desires to cast when memoriz- 
ing the spell, unless the spell description spe- 
cifically states otherwise. For example, a 
wizard who has memorized stone to flesh 
and desires to cast flesh to stone must wait 
until the latter form of the spell can be mem- 
orized (i.e., rest eight hours and study). If he 
could memorize two 6th-level spells, he 
could memorize each version once or one 
version twice. 

School: In parentheses after the spell 
name is the name of the school of magic to 
which the spell belongs. For wizard spells, 
this defines which spells a wizard specialist 
can learn, depending on the wizard’s school 
of specialization. For priest spells, the 
school notation is used only for reference 
purposes, to indicate which school the spell 
is considered to belong to, in case the DM 
needs to know for spell resistance (e.g., 
elves’ resistance to charm spells). 

Sphere: This entry appears only for priest 
spells and identifies the sphere or spheres 
into which that spell falls. 

Range: This lists the distance from the 
caster at which the spell effect occurs or 
begins. A “0” indicates the spell can be used 
on the caster only, with the effect embodied 
within or emanating from him. “Touch” 
means the caster can use the spell on others 
if he can physically touch them. Unless oth- 
erwise specified, all other spells are centered 
on a point visible to the caster and within 
the range of the spell. The point can be a 
creature or object if desired. In general, a 
spell that affects a limited number of crea- 
tures within an area affects those closest to 
the center of the area first, unless there are 
other parameters operating (such as level or 
Hit Dice). Spells can be cast through narrow 
openings only if both the caster’s vision and 
the spell energy can be directed simultane- 
ously through the opening. A wizard stand- 
ing behind an arrow slit can cast through it; 
sending a fireball through a small peephole 
he is peering through is another matter. 

Components: This lists the category of 
components needed, V for verbal, S for 
somatic, and M for material. When material 
components are required, these are listed in 
the spell description. Spell components are 
expended as the spell is cast, unless other- 


Magic (Spell Descriptions) 


wise noted. Clerical holy symbols are not 
Jost when a spell is cast. For cases in which 
material components are expended at the 
end of the spell (free action, shapechange, 
etc.), premature destruction of the compo- 
nents ends the spell. 

Duration: This lists how long the magical 
energy of the spell lasts. Spells of instanta- 
neous duration come and go the moment 
they are cast, although the results of these 
spells may be permanent and unchangeable 
by normal means. Spells of permanent 
duration last until the effects are negated by 
some means, usually by a dispel magic. 
Some spells have a variable duration. In 
most cases, the caster cannot choose the 
duration of spells. Spells with set durations 
(e.g., 3 rounds/level) must be kept track of 
by the player. Spells of variable duration 
(e.g., 3 + 1d4 rounds) are secretly rolled 
and recorded by the DM. Your DM may 
warn you when spell durations are 
approaching expiration, but there is usually 
no sign that a spell is going to expire; check 
with your DM to determine exactly how he 
handles this issue. 

Certain spells can be ended at will by the 
caster. In order to dismiss these spells, the 
original caster must be within range of the 
spell’s center of effect—within the same 
range at which the spell can be cast. The 
caster also must be able to speak words of 
dismissal. Note that only the original caster 
can dismiss his spells in this way. 

Casting Time: This entry is important, if 
the optional casting time rules are used. If 
only a number is given, the casting time is 
added to the caster’s initiative die rolls. If 
the spell requires a round or number of 
rounds to cast, it goes into effect at the end 
of the last round of casting time. If 
Delsenora casts a spell that takes one round, 
it goes into effect at the end of the round in 
which she begins casting. If the spell 
requires three rounds to cast, it goes into 
effect at the end of the third round. Spells 
requiring a turn or more go into effect at the 
end of the stated turn. 

Area of Effect: This lists the creatures, 
volume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can 
be affected by the spell. Spells with an area 
or volume that can be shaped by the caster 
will have a minimum dimension of 10 feet in 
any direction, unless the spell description 
specifically states otherwise. Thus a cloud 
that has a 10-foot cube per caster level 
might, when cast by a 12th-level caster, 
have dimensions 10' X 10’ xX 120’, 20' x 
20' X 30’, or any similar combination that 
totals twelve 10-foot cubes. Combinations 
such as 5’ X 10’ X 240’ are not possible 
unless specifically allowed. 

Some spells (such as bless) affect the 
friends or enemies of the caster. In all cases, 
this refers to the perception of the caster at 
the time the spell is cast. For example, a cha- 
otic good character allied with a lawful neu- 


tral cleric would receive the benefits of the 
latter's bless spell. 

Saving Throw: This lists whether the spell 
allows the target a saving throw and the 
effect of a successful save: “Neg.” results in 
the spell having no effect; “1/2” means the 
character suffers half the normal amount of 
damage; “none” means no saving throw is 
allowed. 

Wisdom adjustments to saving throws 
apply to enchantment/charm spells. 

Solid physical barriers provide saving 
throw bonuses and damage reduction. Cov- 
er and concealment may affect saving 
throws and damage (the DM has additional 
information about this). 

A creature that successfully saves against 
a spell with no apparent physical effect 
(such as a charm, hold, or magic jar) may 
feel a definite force or tingle that is charac- 
teristic of a magical attack, if the DM 
desires. But the exact hostile spell effect or 
creature ability used cannot be deduced 
from this tingle. 

A being’s carried equipment and posses- 
sions are assumed to make their saving 
throws against special attacks if the creature 
makes its saving throw, unless the spell spe- 
cifically states otherwise. If the creature fails 
its saving throw, or if the attack form is par- 
ticularly potent, the possessions may 
require saving throws using either item sav- 
ing throws (see the DMG) or the being’s sav- 
ing throw. The DM will inform you when 
this happens. 

Any character can voluntarily forgo a 
saving throw. This allows a spell or similar 
attack that normally grants a saving throw 
to have full effect on the character. Like- 
wise, any creature can voluntarily lower its 
magic resistance allowing a spell to auto- 
matically function when cast on it. Forgoing 
a saving throw or magic resistance roll need 
not always be voluntary. If a creature or 


character can be tricked into lowering its 
resistance, the spell will have full effect, 
even if it is not the spell the victim believed 
he was going to receive. The victim must 
consciously choose to lower his resistance; 
it is not sufficient that he is caught off guard. 
For example, a character would receive a 
saving throw if a mage in the party suddenly 
attacked him with a fireball, even if the 
mage had been friendly to that point. How- 
ever, the same character would not receive a 
saving throw if the mage convinced him 
that he was about to receive a levitation 
spell but cast a fireball instead. Your DM 
will decide when NPCs have lowered their 
resistances. You must tell your DM when 
your character is voluntarily lowering his 
resistance. 

Spell Description: The text provides a 
complete description of how the spell func- 
tions and its game effects. It covers most 
typical uses of the spell, if there are more 
than one, but cannot deal with every possi- 
ble application players might find. In these 
cases, the spell information in the text 
should provide guidance on how to adjudi- 
cate the situation. 

Spells with multiple functions enable the 
caster to select which function he wants to 
use at the time of casting. Usually a single 
function of a multiple-function spell is 
weaker than a single-function spell of the 
same level. 

Spell effects that give bonuses or penalties 
to abilities, attack rolls, damage rolls, sav- 
ing throws, etc., are not usually cumulative 
with each other or with other magic: the 
strongest single effect applies. For example, 
a fighter drinks a potion of giant strength 
and then receives the 2nd-level wizard spell 
strength. Only the strongest magic (the 
potion) is effective. When the potion’s dura- 
tion ends, however, the strength spell is still 
in effect, until its duration also expires. 


ms 


After a player's character has bravely set 
out and survived his first adventure, the 
player will have experienced the entertain- 
ment of role-playing games. But what will 
the character have gained? If the character 
never improves, he will never be able to sur- 
vive, let alone overcome the powerful dan- 
gers that fill the AD&D® game worlds. 

Fortunately, this isn’t the case. Every time 
a character goes on an adventure he learns 
something. He may learn a little more about 
his physical limits, encounter a creature he 
has never seen before, try a spell as yet 
unused, or discover a new peculiarity of 
nature. Indeed, not all his learning experi- 
ence need be positive. After blowing up half 
his party with a poorly placed fireball, a 
wizard may (though there is no guarantee) 
learn to pay more attention to ranges and 
areas of effect. After charging a basilisk, a 
fighter may learn that caution is a better tac- 
tic for dealing with the beast (provided the 
other characters can him from stone 
back to flesh). Regardless of the method, the 
character has managed to learn something. 

Some of the information and skills 
learned in the game can be applied directly 
in play. When a wizard toasts his friends 
with a badly cast fireball, the player learns 
to pay more attention to the area of effect of 
a fireball. Though the player made the mis- 
take and his character only carried out the 
actions, the player's friends will also learn to 
keep their characters well away from his. 

The reward for this type of learning is 
direct and immediate. The characters bene- 
fit because each of the players has a better 
understanding of what to do or where to go. 

However, a character also improves by 
increasing his power. Although the player 
can improve his play, he cannot arbitrarily 
give his character more hit points, more 
spells, or a better chance to hit with an 
attack, These gains are made by earning 
experience points (XP). 

An experience point is a concrete measure 
of a character's improvement. It represents a 
host of abstract factors: increased confi- 
dence, physical exercise, insight, and on- 
the-job training. When a character earns 
enough experience points to advance to the 
next experience level, these abstract factors 
translate into a measurable improvement in 
the abilities of the character. Just what areas 
improve and how quickly improvement 
occurs all depend on the character's class. 


Group Experience Awards 


Experience points 
are earned through the activities of the char- 
acters, which generally relate to their 
adventuring goals. Thus all characters on an 
adventure receive some experience points 
for overcoming their enemies or obstacles. 
Since group cooperation is important, expe- 
rience points for defeating foes are given to 


Chapter 8: Experience 


all members of the group, regardless of their 
actions. Who is to say that the wizard, 
standing ready with a spell just in case 
things got ugly, might not have been neces- 
sary? Or that the bard who covered the par- 
ty’s escape route wasn’t doing something 
important? A character who never hefts a 
sword may still have good advice or impor- 
tant suggestions on better tactics. Further- 
more, the wizard and the bard can also learn 
from the actions of others. 


Individual 
Experience Awards 


Player characters 
also earn experience points for individual 
deeds, as determined by their class. Gener- 
ally, each character earns points for doing 
actions appropriate to his group. Warriors 
earn additional experience points for defeat- 
ing creatures. The more difficult the battle, 
the greater the number of experience points. 
Wizards earn points for using their spells for 
specific purposes. The wizard who walks 
into the woods and casts his spells for no 
reason doesn’t gain experience points; the 
wizard who casts a lightning bolt at a 
beholder has used his spell for a purpose. He 
gains experience points. Wizards also earn 
experience points for researching new spells 
and creating magical items. Priests can earn 
experience points by spreading their beliefs 
and using their powers in service of their 
deity. Rogues, who tend to have a larcenous 
streak, earn experience points by using their 
special abilities and finding or earning gold. 

A character can also earn experience for 
the player's actions, such as playing the 
game well. When a player does a good job 
creating and pretending to be his character, 
the DM may give the character experience 
points for good role-playing. If the player is 
really involved and takes a major part in the 
game, the DM can give the player's charac- 
ter extra experience points. If the player uses 
his head to come up with a really good idea, 
the DM can give the character experience 
points for his contribution. 

Finally, a character can earn experience 
points for successfully completing an 
adventure or achieving a goal the DM has 

= 


set. Although a player may have a pretty 
good idea of what his character is supposed 
to accomplish, he won’t know if he'll be 
awarded experience points for it until his 
character actually receives them. However, 
there is no rule that the DM must be consist- 
ent in these awards, or even that he must 
give a character anything at all. 


Training 


Even when a char- 
acter has earned enough experience to attain 
the next level, the DM may not allow imme- 
diate advancement. He may require the 
character to receive training to advance. 
When training, a character studies his skills 
under a tutor, taking the raw knowledge he 
has gained and honing it into measurable 
improvement. On the average, this takes a 
few weeks (depending on the tutor’s ability), 
and it is normally done during the charac- 
ter’s nonadventuring time. 

A DM can also rule that the circumstanc- 
es are not appropriate for the character to 
advance in level. For instance, if the game 
session ends with the characters deep in an 
abandoned mine complex. The party has 
just finished a battle with a band of gnolls 
and faces more such encounters before it 
can reach the surface. The DM rules that the 
characters receive no experience until they 
leave the mines, because he doesn’t want 
them to increase in level in the middle of the 
adventure. He is perfectly justified in doing 
this. And if the characters live through the 
adventure, they will undoubtedly profit 
from it, either in experience points or 
knowledge gained. 


Where’s the 
Specific Info? 


The preceding text 
has covered general guidelines as to how 
and why characters receive experience 
points. Since the DM actually determines 
how many XP each character actually 
receives, the detailed rules for awarding 
experience are given in the Dungeon Mas- 
ter's Guide. 


Chapter 9: Combat 


The AD&D® game is an adventure game de- 
signed to give players a feeling of excitement 
and danger. Characters brave the unknown 
perils of moldering dungeons and thorn- 
covered wilderness, facing off against hid- 
eous monsters and evil villains. Thus, it is 
important for all players to know the basic 
rules for handling combat. 

To create the proper sense of danger and 
excitement, the rules for combat must be 
thorough, but they must also be playable 
and exciting enough to create a vivid picture 
in the minds of the players. Combat in the 
AD&D game has to allow many different 
actions and outcomes—as many as the 
imagination can produce. Knowing that 
anything could happen next (because the 
rules allow it) creates excitement for every- 
one. 


More Than Just Hack-and-Slash 


As important as 
fighting is to the AD&D game, it isn’t the be- 
all and end-all of play. It’s just one way for 
characters to deal with situations. If charac- 
ters could do nothing but fight, the game 
would quickly get boring—every encounter 
would be the same. Because there is more to 
the game than fighting, we'll cover much 
more than simple hack-and-slash combat in 
this chapter. 

In addition to explaining the basic me- 
chanics of hitting and missing, there are 
rules here for turning undead, special ways 
to attack and defend, poison, heroic feats, 
and more. 


Definitions 


Many game terms 
are used throughout the combat rules. To 
understand the rules, players must under- 
stand these terms, so brief explanations ap- 
pear below. Further details are provided 
throughout this chapter. 

Armor Class (AC) is the protective rating 
of a type of armor. In some circumstances, 
AC is modified by the amount of protection 
gained or lost because of the character's situ- 
ation. For instance, crouching behind a 
boulder improves a character's Armor 
Class, while being attacked from behind 
worsens his AC. 

Armor provides protection by reducing 
the chance that a character is attacked suc- 
cessfully (and suffers damage). Armor does 
not absorb damage, it prevents it. A fighter 
in full plate mail may be a slow-moving tar- 
get, but penetrating his armor to cause any 
damage is no small task. 

Armor Class is measured on a scale from 
10, the worst (no armor), to —10, the best 
(very powerful magical armors). The lower 
the number, the more effective the armor. 
Shields can also improve the AC of a char- 
acter (see page 75). 


Abilities and situations can also affect a 
character's Armor Class. High Dexterity 
gives a bonus to Armor Class, for example. 
But even a character with a Dexterity bonus 
can have this bonus negated if he is attacked 
from the rear. 

Damage is what happens to a character 
when an opponent attacks him successfully. 
Damage can also occur as a result of poison, 
fire, falling, acid, and anything even re- 
motely dangerous in the real world. Dam- 
age from most attacks is measured in hit 
points, Each time a character is hit, he suf- 
fers points of damage. It could be as little as 
1 point to as many as 80 or more. These 
points are subtracted from the character's 
current hit point total. When this reaches 0, 
the character is dead. 

Initiative determines the order in which 
things happen in a combat round. Like so 
many things in the world, initiative is deter- 
mined by a combination of ability, situa- 
tion, and chance. 

At the start of each round of a battle, an 
initiative roll is made by both sides. This 
roll can be modified by the abilities of the 
combatants and by the situation. The per- 
son or side with the lower modified die roll 
acts first. 

Melee is any situation in which charac- 
ters are battling each other hand-to-hand, 
whether with fists, teeth, claws, swords, 
axes, pikes, or something else. Strength and 
Dexterity are valuable assets in melee. 

Missile combat is defined as any time a 
weapon is shot, thrown, hurled, kicked, or 
otherwise propelled. Missile and melee 
combat have the same basic rules, but there 
are special situations and modifiers that ap- 
ply only to missile combat. 

Saving throws are measures of a charac- 
ter’s resistance to special types of attacks— 
poisons, magic, and attacks that affect the 
whole body or mind of the character. The 
ability to make successful saving throws im- 
proves as the character increases in level; 
Dexterity and general mental fortitude aid 
in honing combat senses. Experience makes 
saving throws easier. 

Surprise can happen any time characters 
meet another group unexpectedly (monsters, 
evil knights, peasants, etc.). Surprise is simply 
what happens when one side—a person or 
party—is taken unawares, unable to react un- 
til they gather their wits. Their opponents, if 
unsurprised, are allowed a bonus round of 
action while the ised characters recover. 
It's entirely possible for both sides in a given 
situation to be surprised! 

Attacking with surprise gives bonuses to 
the attack roll (see Table 51). A surprised 
character also has a decreased chance of 
rolling a successful saving throw, if one is 
needed. 

Surprise is determined by a die roll and is 
normally checked at the beginning of an 
encounter. Surprise is very unpredictable, 


89 


so there are very few modifiers to the roll. 
THAC0 is an acronym for “To Hit Armor 
Class 0." This is the number a character, 
NPC, or monster needs to attack an Armor 
Class 0 target successfully. THACO depends 
on a character's group and level (see Table 
53 on page 91). The THACO number can be 
used to calculate the number needed to hit 
any Armor Class. THACO is refigured each 
time a character increases in level. Using 
THACO speeds the play of combat greatly. 


The Attack Roll 


At the heart of the 
combat system is the attack roll. This is the 
die roll that determines whether an attack 
succeeds or fails. The number a player needs 
in order to make a successful attack roll is 
also called the “to-hit” number. 

Attack rolls are used for attacks with 
swords, bows, rocks, and other weapons, as 
well as blows from fists, tackling, and other 
hand-to-hand attacks. Attack rolls are also 
used to resolve a variety of potentially 
injury-causing actions that require accuracy 
(e.g., throwing a rock at a small target or 
tossing a sword to a party member in the 
middle of a fight). 


Figuring the To-Hit Number 


The first step in 
making an attack roll is to find the number 
needed to hit the target. Subtract the Armor 
Class of the target from the attacker's 
THACO. (Remember that if the Armor 
Class is a negative number, you add it to the 
attacker's THACO.) The character has to 
roll the resulting number, or higher, on 1d20 
to hit the target. 


Here's a simple example: Rath has 
reached 7th level as a fighter. His THACO is 
14 (found on Table 53), meaning he needs to 
roll a 14 or better to hit a character or crea- 
ture of Armor Class 0. In combat, Rath, at- 
tacking an orc wearing chainmail armor 
(AC 6), needs to roll an 8 (14-6 = 8) to hit 
the orc. An 8 or higher on 1d20 will hit the 
orc. If Rath hits, he rolls the appropriate 
dice (see Table 44) to determine how much 
damage he inflicts. 


The example above is quite simple—in a 
typical AD&D® game combat situation, 
THACO is modified by weapon bonuses, 
Strength bonuses, and the like (the next sec- 
tion “Modifiers to the Attack Roll,” lists the 
specifics of these modifiers). Figure Strength 
and weapon modifiers, subtract the total 
from the base THACO, and record this mod- 
ified THACO with each weapon on the char- 
acter sheet. Subtract the target’s Armor 
Class from this modified THACO when de- 
termining the to-hit number. 


Combat (Weapon Type vs. Armor) 


Here's the same example, with some com- 
mon modifiers thrown in: Rath is still a 7th- 
level fighter. He has a Strength of 18/80 
(which gives him a +2 bonus to his attack 
roll). He fights with a long sword +1. His 
THAC0 is 14, modified to 12 by his Strength 
and to 11 by his weapon. If attacking the orc 
from the earlier example, Rath would have 
to roll a 5 or higher on 1A20 in order to hit 
(11-6=5). Again, Table 44 would tell him 
how much damage he inflicts with his 
weapon (this information should also be 
written on his character sheet). 


The DM may also throw in situational 
modifiers, (e.g., a bonus if the target is 
struck from behind, or a penalty if the target 
is crouching behind a boulder). If the final, 
modified die roll on 1d20 is equal to or 
greater than the number needed to hit the 
target, the attack succeeds. If the roll is 
lower than that needed, the attack fails. 


Modifiers to the Attack Roll 


In combat, many 
factors can modify the number a character 
needs for a successful hit. These variables 
are reflected in modifiers to the to-hit num- 
ber or to the attack roll. 

Strength Modifiers: A character's 
Strength can modify the die roll, altering 
both the chance to hit and the damage 
caused. This modifier is always applied to 
melees and attacks with hurled missile 
weapons (a spear or an axe). 

A positive Strength modifier can be applied 
to bows if the character has a special bow 
made for him, designed to take advantage of 
his high Strength. Characters with Strength 
penalties always suffer them when using a 
bow weapon. They simply are not able to 
draw back the bowstring far enough. Charac- 
ters never have Strength modifiers when using 
crossbows—the power of the shot is imparted 
by a machine, not the player character. 

Magical items: The magical properties of 
a weapon can also modify combat. Items 
that impart a bonus to the attack roll or Ar- 
mor Class are identified by a plus sign. For 
example, asword +1 improves a character's 
chance to hit by one. A suit of chain mail 
+1 improves the Armor Class of the char- 
acter by one (which means you subtract one 
from the character's AC, changing an AC of 
5 to an AC of 4, for example). Cursed items 
have a negative modifier (a penalty), result- 
ing in a subtraction from the attack roll or 
an addition to Armor Class. 

There is no limit to the number of modi- 
fiers that can be applied to a single die roll. 
Nor is there a limit to the positive or nega- 
tive number (the total of all modifiers) that 
can be applied to a die roll. 

Table 51 lists some standard combat mod- 
ifiers. Positive numbers are bonuses for the 
attacker; negative numbers are penalties.

“If the defender is attacked during the 
course of a normal melee, the attack auto- 
matically hits and cause5 normal damage. If 
no other fighting is going on (i.e., all others 
have been slain or driven off), the defender 
can be slain automatically. 


Weapon Type vs. 
Armor Modifiers 


(Optional Rule) 


Not all weapons 
perform the same. If they did, there 
would be no need for the wide variety of 
weapons that exists. Only one form of 
each weapon-type, the most useful one, 
would be used throughout the world. 
This is obviously not the case. 

Aside from the differences in size, 
weight, length, and shape, certain types 
of weapons are more useful against some 
types of armor than others. Indeed, the 
different armors and weapons of the 
world are the result of an ancient arms 
race. Every new weapon led to the devel- 
opment of a new type of armor designed 
to counter it. This led to new weapons, 
which led to new armor, and so on. 


The Various Types of Weapons 


In the AD&D® 
game, weapons fall into several catego- 
ries, based on how they are used. The ba- 
sic categories are slashing, piercing, and 
bludgeoning. 

Slashing weapons include swords, 
axes, and knives. Damage is caused by 
the combination of weight, muscle, and 
a good sharp edge. 

Piercing weapons (some swords, 
spears, pikes, arrows, javelins, etc.) rely 
on the penetrating power of a single 
sharp point and much less on the weight 
of the weapon. 

Bludgeoning weapons (maces, ham- 
mers, and flails) depend almost entirely 
on the impact caused by weight and mus- 
cle 


A few weapons, particularly some of 


the more exotic polearms, fall into more 
than one of these categories. A halberd 


90 


can be used as a pole-axe (a slashing 
weapon) or as a short pike (a piercing 
weapon). The versatility of these weap- 
ons provides the user with a combat ad- 
vantage, in that the mode most favorable 
to the attacker can be used, depending 
upon the situation. 

Natural weapons can also be classified 
according to their attack type. Claws are 
slashing weapons; a bite pierces; a tail- 
attack bludgeons. The DM must decide 
which is most appropriate to the creature 
and method of attack. 

Armor types, in turn, have different 
qualities. Field plate is more effective, 
overall, than other armors by virtue of 
the amount and thickness of the metal, 
but it still has specific weaknesses against 
certain classes of weapons. 

Table 52 lists the weapon vs. armor 
modifiers applied to the attacker’s 
THACO, if this optional system is used. 
To use this table, the actual armor type of 
the target must be known in addition to 
the target's Armor Class. The bonuses of 
magical armor do not change the type of 
armor, only the final Armor Class. 

This system is used only when attack- 
ing creatures in armor. The modifiers are 
not used when attacking creatures with a 
natural Armor Class.

Impossible To-Hit Numbers 


Sometimes the at- 
tacker’s to-hit number seems impossible to 
roll. An attack may be so difficult it requires 
a roll greater than 20 (on a 20-sided die!), or 
so ridiculously easy it can be made on a roll 
less than 1. In both cases, an attack roll is 
still required! 

The reason is simple: With positive die 
roll modifiers (for magic, Strength, situa- 
tion, or whatever), a number greater than 
20 can be rolled. Likewise, die roll penalties 
can push the attack roll below 0. 

No matter what number a character needs 


Combat (Calculating THACO) 


to hit, a roll of 20 is always considered a hit 
and a roll of 1 is always a miss, unless the 
DM rules otherwise. Under most circum- 
stances, a natural 20 hits and a natural 1 
misses, regardless of any modifiers applied 
to the die roll. 

Thus, even if a character's chance to hit a 
monster is 23 and the character has a —3 
penalty applied to the die roll, he might be 
able to score a hit—but only if the die roll is 
a 20 before any modifiers are applied. Like- 
wise, a character able to hit a monster on a3 
or better, waving a sword +4, could still 
miss if a 1 is rolled on the die. 

There are no sure things, good or bad, in 
the unpredictable chaos of combat situa- 
tions. 


Calculating THACO 


To make an attack 
roll, the character's THACO must be known. 
This depends on the group and level, if the 
attacker is a player character or NPC, or the 
Hit Dice if the attacker is a monster or an ani- 
mal. All 1st-level characters have THACOs of 
20, regardless of class. 

For a character of level 1 through level 20, 
consult Table 53. This table lists the THACO 
number of each group through 20th level, so 
players don’t have to perform any calcula- 
tions. 

For a character higher than 20th level, 
find the Improvement Rate for the charac- 
ter’s group in Table 54. There you'll find the 
number of levels a character must advance 
to reduce his THACO by 1 (or more) points. 
Calculate the character's THACO according 
to his level. 

* The DMG contains the information on 
monster THACOs.

Combat and Encounters 


Encounters are the 
heart of the AD&D® game. Since encoun- 
ters with monsters and NPCs often lead to 
combat, an understanding of what happens 
during battles is vital for everyone. There 
are several factors the DM will consider in 
any combat, most of which arise from the 
circumstances of the encounter. Is anyone 
surprised? How far apart are the oppo- 
nents? How many of them are there? 
Answers to these questions are found in the 
Encounter section of the DMG. These are 
questions common to all encounters, 
whether combat occurs or not. 


The Combat Round 


If an encounter es- 
calates into a combat situation, the time 
scale of the game automatically goes to 
rounds (also called melee rounds or combat 
rounds). Rounds are used to measure the 
actions of characters in combat (or other 
intensive actions in which time is impor- 
tant). 

A round is approximately one minute 
long. Ten combat rounds equal a turn (or, 
put another way, a turn equals 10 minutes of 
game time). This is particularly important 
to remember for spells that last for turns, 
rather than rounds. 

But these are just approximations— 
precise time measurements are impossible to 
make in combat. An action that might be 
ridiculously easy under normal circum- 
stances could become an undertaking of tru- 
ly heroic scale when attempted in the middle 
of a furious, chaotic battle. 

Imagine the simple act of imbibing a heal- 
ing potion. First, a character decides to 
drink the potion before retiring for the 
night. All he has to do is get it out of his 
backpack, uncork it, and drink the con- 
tents. No problem. 

Now imagine the same thing in the middle 
of a fight. The potion is safely stowed in the 
character’s backpack. First, he takes stock 
of the situation to see if anyone else can get 
the potion out for him, but, not surprising- 
ly, everyone is rather busy. So, sword in one 
hand, he shrugs one strap of the pack off his 
shoulder. Then, just as two orcs leap toward 
him, the other strap threatens to slip down, 
entangling his sword arm. Already the loose 
strap keeps him from fully using his shield. 

Holding the shield as best as possible in 
front of him, he scrambles backward to 
avoid the monsters’ first wild swings. He 
gets pushed back a few more feet when a 
companion shoulders past to block their 
advance. His companion bought him a little 
time, so he kneels, lays down his sword, and 
slips the backpack all the way off. Hearing a 
wild cry, he instinctively swings his shield 
up just in time to ward off a glancing blow. 


shit ie | 
i Uh Hel} | 


Combat (The Combat Sequence) 


Rummaging through the pack, he finally 
finds the potion, pulls it out, and, huddling 
behind his shield, works the cork free. Just 
then there is a flash of flame all around 
him—a fireball! He grits his teeth against 
the heat, shock, and pain and tries to 
remember not to crush or spill the potion 
vial. Biting back the pain of the flames, he is 
relieved to see the potion is still intact. 

Quickly, he gulps it down, reclaims his 
sword, kicks his backpack out of the way, 
and runs back up to the front line. In game 
terms, the character withdrew, was missed 
by one attacker, made a successful saving 
throw vs. spell (from the fireball), drank a 
potion, and was ready for combat the next 
round. 


What You Can Do in One Round 


Whatever the pre- 
cise length of a combat round, a character 
can accomplish only one basic action in that 
round, be it making an attack, casting a 
spell, drinking a potion, or tending to a 
fallen comrade. The basic action, however, 
may involve several lesser actions. 

When making an attack, a character is 
likely to close with his opponent, circle for 
an opening, feint here, jab there, block a 
thrust, leap back, and perhaps finally make 
a telling blow. A spellcaster may fumble for 
his components, dodge an attacker, mental- 
ly review the steps of the spell, intone the 
spell, and then move to safety when it is all 
done. It has already been shown what 
drinking a potion might entail. All of these 
things might happen in a bit less than a min- 
ute or a bit more, but the standard is one 
minute and one action to the round. 

Some examples of the actions a character 
can accomplish include the following: 

@ Make an attack (make attack rolls up to 
the maximum number allowed the char- 
acter class at a given level) 

® Cast one spell (if the casting time is one 
round or less) 

e Drink a potion 

e Light a torch 

© Use a magical item 

© Move to the limit of his movement rate 

e Attempt to open a stuck or secret door 

® Bind a character's wounds 

e Search a body 

e Hammer in a spike 

e Recover a dropped weapon 


There are also actions that take a negligi- 
ble amount of time, things the character 
does without affecting his ability to perform 
a more important task. Examples of these 
include the following: 
® Shout warnings, brief instructions, or 

demands for surrender, but not conversa- 

tions where a reply is expected. 
® Change weapons by dropping one and 
drawing another. 


e Drop excess equipment, such as back- 
packs, lanterns, or torches. 


The Combat Sequence 


In real life, combat 
is one of the closest things to pure anarchy. 
Each side is attempting to harm the other, 
essentially causing disorder and chaos. 
Thus combats are filled with unknowns— 
unplanned events, failed attacks, lack of 
communication, and general confusion and 
uncertainty. However, to play a battle in the 
game, it is necessary to impose some order 
on the actions that occur. Within a combat 
round, there is a set series of steps that must 
be followed. These steps are: 


1. The DM decides what actions the 
monsters or NPCs will take, including 
casting spells (if any). 

2. The players indicate what their char- 
acters will do, including casting spells 
(if any). 

3. Initiative is determined. 

4. Attacks are made in order of initiative. 


These steps are followed until the combat 
ends—either one side is defeated, surren- 
ders, or runs away. 

NPC/Monster Determination: In the first 
step, the DM secretly decides in general 
terms what each opponent will do—attack, 
flee, or cast a spell. He does not announce 
his decisions to the players. If a spell is to be 
cast, the DM picks the spell before the play- 
ers announce their characters’ actions. 

Player Determination: Next, the players 
give a general indication of what their char- 
acters are planning to do. This does not 
have to be perfectly precise and can be 
changed somewhat, if the DM decides cir- 
cumstances warrant. 

If the characters are battling goblins, a 
player can say, “My fighter will attack” 
without having to announce which goblin 
he will strike. If the characters are battling a 
mixed group of goblins and ogres, the play- 
er has to state whether his character is 
attacking goblins or ogres. 

Spells to be cast must also be announced 
at this time and cannot be changed once the 
initiative die is rolled. 

Before moving on, the DM will make sure 
he has a clear idea of not only what the play- 
er characters are doing, but also what 
actions any hirelings and henchmen are tak- 
ing. Once he has a clear view of everything 
that's likely to happen, the DM can overrule 
any announced action that violates the rules 
(or in the case of an NPC, is out of charac- 
ter). 

He is not required to overrule an impos- 
sible action, but he can let a character 
attempt it anyway, knowing full well the 
character cannot succeed. It is not the DM’s 
position to advise players on the best strate- 


93 


gies, most intelligent actions, or optimum 
maneuvers for their characters. 

Initiative: In the third step, dice are rolled 
to determine initiative, according to the 
rules for initiative (this page). 

Resolution: In the last step, PCs, NPCs, 
and monsters make their attacks, spells 
occur, and any other actions are resolved 
according to the order of initiative. 


The above sequence is not immutable. 
Indeed, some monsters violate the standard 
sequence, and some situations demand the 
application of common sense. In these cases 
the DM's word is final. 

Here's an example of the combat sequence 
in action: Rath is leading a party through 
the corridors of a dungeon. Right behind 
him are Rupert and Delsenora. Rounding a 
bend, they see a group of orcs and trolls 
about 20 feet away. No one is surprised by 
the encounter. 

The DM has notes telling him the orcs are 
hesitant. He secretly decides that they will 
fall back and let the trolls fight. The trolls, 
able to regenerate, are naturally overconfi- 
dent and step forward to the front rank 
(cursing the orcs at the same time) and pre- 
pare to attack. Turning to the players, the 
DM asks, “What are you going to do?” 


Harry (playing Rath, a dwarf who hates 
orcs): “Orcs?—CHARGE!" 

Anne (playing Delsenora the Mage): “Uh— 
what!? Wait—don't do that...] was 
going to...now I can't use a fireball.” 

DM: “Rath is charging forward. Quick— 
what are you doing?” 

Jon (playing Rupert, the half-elf, to Anne): 
“Cast a spell! (To DM) Can I fire my bow 
over him?” 

DM: “Sure, he’s short.” 

Jon: “OK, I'll shoot at ores.” 

DM: “Anne, tell me what Delsenora's doing 
or she'll lose the round trying to make up 
her mind!” 

Anne: “Got it!—Acid arrow spell at the lead 
troll.” 

DM: “Fine. Harry, Rath is in front. Roll for 
initiative.” 


Initiative 


The initiative roll 
determines who acts first in any given com- 
bat round. Initiative is not set, but changes 
from round to round (combat being an 
uncertain thing, at best). A character never 
knows for certain if he will get to act before 
another. 

Initiative is normally determined with a 
single roll for each side in a conflict. This 
tells whether all the members of the group 
get to act before or after those of the other 
side(s). 

There are also two optional methods that 
can be used to determine initiative. Each of 
these optional methods breaks the group 


Combat (Initiative) 


action down into more individual initia- 
tives. However, the general method of de- 
termining initiative remains the same in all 
cases. 


Standard Initiative Procedure 


To determine the 
initiative order for a round of combat, roll 
1d10 for each side in the battle. Normally, 
this means the DM rolls for the monsters (or 
NPCs), while one of the players rolls for the 
PC party. Low roll wins initiative. If more 
than two sides are involved in combat, the 
remaining sides act in ascending order of 
initiative. 

If both (or all) sides roll the same number 
for initiative, everything happens sim- 
ultaneously—all attack rolls, damage, 
spells, and other actions are completed be- 
fore any results are applied. It is possible for 
a mage to be slain by goblins who collapse 
from his sleep spell at the end of the round. 


Initiative Modifiers 


Situational factors 
can affect who has initiative. To reflect this, 
modifiers are added to or subtracted from 
the initiative die roll. 


Table 55: STANDARD MODIFIERS 


TO INITIATIVE 
Specific Situation Modifier 
Hasted -2 
Slowed +2 
On higher ground =i 
Set to receive a charge =2 
Wading or slippery footing +2 
Wading in deep water +4 
Foreign environment* +6 
Hindered (tangled, climbing, held) +3 
Waiting (see p. 112) +1 


* This applies to situations in which the 
party is in a completely different environ- 
ment (swimming underwater without the 
aid of a ring of free movement, for exam- 
ple). 


Everyone in the party who will be in- 
volved in the round’s action must qualify 
for the modifier. For example, all members 
of a party must be on higher ground than 
the opposition in order to get the higher 
ground modifier. The DM will probably ask 
each player where his character is standing 
in order to clarify this. 

The side with the lowest modified roll on 
1d10 has the initiative and acts first. 


Continuing the example above, the DM 
decides that one initiative roll is sufficient 
for each group and no modifiers are needed 
for either group. (Although Rath is charg- 
ing, the orcs and trolls are too busy rear- 
ranging their lines to be set to receive his 


charge and so the —2 to receive charge is not 
used.) 

Harry, rolling for the player characters, 
gets a7 on a10-sided die. The DM rolls a 10. 
The player characters, having the lowest 
number, act first. 

Delsenora's acid arrow strikes one of the 
trolls just as Rath takes a swing at the last of 
the fleeing orcs. A bowshot from Rupert 
drops another one of the creatures as it takes 
its position in the second rank. Now the 
monsters strike back. 

The orcs manage to finish forming their 
line. Enraged by the acid, the lead troll tears 
into Rath, hurting him badly. The others 
swarm around him, attempting to tear him 
limb from limb.

** Use the initiative modifier listed unless the item description says otherwise. 


Combat (Initiative) 


Some of the modifiers depend on ability, 
spell, and weapon. Characters casting spells 
(but not monsters using innate abilities) 
must add the spellcasting time to the die 
roll. Characters attacking with weapons 
add the weapons’ speed factors to the die 
roll (see pages 68 and 69). All other modi- 
fiers are applied according to each individ- 
ual's situation, 


Example: In the second round of the 
combat, the DM decides to use the modi- 
fied group initiative. Rath is surrounded 
by trolls and not in the best of health. 
The rest of the party has yet to close with 
the monsters. 

The DM decides that one troll will 
continue attacking Rath, with the help of 
the orcs, while the other trolls move to 
block reinforcements. In particular, the 
troll burned by the acid arrow is looking 
for revenge. The DM then turns to the 
players for their actions. 


Players (all at once): “I'm going to..." “Is 
he going?...” “I'm casting a...” 

DM (shouting): “One at time! Rath?" 

Harry: “I'll blow my horn of blasting.” 

DM: “It'll take time to dig it out." 

Harry: “I don't care, I'm doing it.” 

Jon: “Draw my sword and attack one of 
the trolls!” 

DM: “Anne?” 

Anne (not paying attention to the other 
two); "Cast a fireball.” 

Harry and Jon: “NO! DON'T!" 

DM: “Well, is that what you're doing? 
Quickly!" 

Anne: “No, I'll cast a haste spell! Cen- 
tered on me, so Rupert and Rath are 
just at the edge.” 

IM: “Okay. Harry, roll initiative and 
everyone modify for your actions.” 


Harry rolls 1d10 and gets a6. The DM 
rolls for the monsters and gets a 5, Each 
person's initiative is modified as follows: 

Rath is using a miscellaneous magical 
item (modifier +3). His modified initia- 
tive is9(6 + 3 = 9). 

Rupert is using a bastard sword +1 
with two hands (weapon speed 7 instead 
of 8 because of the +1). His modified ini- 
tiative is 13 (6 + 7 = 13). 

Delsenora is casting a spell (haste 
spell, casting time 3). Her modified ini- 
tiative is the same as Rath's, 9. 

The trolls are attacking with their 
claws and bites (large creatures attacking 
with natural weapons +6). Their modi- 
fied initiative is 11 (5 + 6 = 11). 

__ The orcs are using long swords (weap- 
on speed 5). Their modified initiative is 
10 (5 + 5 = 10). 

After all modified initiatives are fig- 
ured, the combat round goes as follows: 
Delsenora (initiative 9) completes her 


spell at the same time that Rath (9) brings 
the house down on the orcs with his horn 
of blasting. 

The ores (initiative 10) would have 
gone next, but all of them have been 
crushed under falling rock. 

The three trolls (initiative 11) are 
unfazed and attack, one at Rath and the 
other two springing forward, hitting 
Delsenora and missing Rupert. 

Finally, Rupert (initiative 13) strikes 
back. He moved too slowly to block one 
trolls path to Delsenora, but manages to 
cut off the second. Things look very grim 
for the player characters. 


Individual Initiative 
(Optional Rule) 

This method of 
determining initiative is the same as that 
just given earlier, except that each PC, 
NPC, and monster involved in the fight 
rolls and then modifies his own initiative 
roll. This gives combat a more realistic 
feel, but at the expense of quick play. 

To players, it may not seem like too 
much for each to roll a separate initiative 
die, but consider the difficulties: Imagine 
a combat between six player characters 
(each controlled by a player) and five 
hirelings and henchmen against 16 hob- 
goblins and five ogres (all of which must 
be rolled by the DM). 

Furthermore, each die roll must be 
modified according to each individual's 
actions. The resulting rolls make every 
combat round a major calculation. 

This method is not recommended for 
large-scale combats. It is best used with 
small battles in which characters on the 
same side have vastly different speeds. 


Example: In the third round of com- 
bat, the DM decides to use individual ini- 
tiatives. Each character is involved in his 
own fight and there aren't too many to 
deal with. Cut off from retreat by fallen 
rock, the trolls attack. The DM asks the 
players their intentions. 


Harry: "Hit him with my hammer +4!” 

Rupert: “Chop him up.” 

Anne (now in serious trouble); “Cast a 
burning hands spell.” 


Each character or monster now rolls 
1d10. The rolls and modified results are: 

Rath rolls a 2 and is attacking with his 
hammer (weapon speed 0 instead of 4 
due to +4) and is hasted (-—2), so his 
modified initiative is 0. 

Rath’s troll rolls a 1 and is attacking 
with natural weapons (+6 modifier) for 
a total of 7 (1 + 6 = 7). 


95 


Rupert rolls a 2 and has a weapon 
speed of 7 and is hasted (—2) for a modi- 
fied initiative of 7 (2 + 7-2 = 7). 

Rupert's troll rolls a 5 and modifies 
this by +6 for an 11 (5 + 6 = 11). 

Delsenora is very unlucky and rolls a 
9. Since she is casting a spell, she gains no 
benefit from the haste spell this round. 
She has a casting time of 1 for a total of 
10 (9 + 1 = 10). 

The troll fighting Delsenora is very 
quick and rolls a 1, modified to 7 (1 + 6 
= 7.) 

The order of attacks is: Rath (initiative 
0) strikes with his hammer. Rupert and 
the two trolls (attacking Rath and 
Delsenora, all initiative 7) attack imme- 
diately after. Rupert hits. The troll 
attacking Rath misses, but Delsenora is 
hit. Delsenora’s spell (initiative 10) 
would normally happen next, but 
instead it fizzles, her concentration 
ruined by the blow from the troll. Next, 
Rupert's troll attacks and misses. 
Because of the haste spell, Rath and 
Rupert now attack again (in order of ini- 
tiative), Rath first, then Rupert. 


Multiple Attacks and Initiative 


Often combat in- 
volves creatures or characters able to attack 
more than once in a single round. This may 
be due to multiple attack forms (claws and 
bite), skill with a weapon, or character 
level. No matter what the reason, all multi- 
ple attacks are handled by one of two meth- 
ods 


When multiple attacks are the result of 
different attack forms—claws and a bite or 
bite and tail or a ranger with his two- 
weapon combat ability for example—the 
attacks all occur at the same time. The crea- 
ture resolves all of its attacks in initiative 
order. 

When the attacks are true multiples— 
using the same weapon more than once—as 
in the case of a highly skilled fighter, the 
attacks are staggered. Everyone involved in 
the combat completes one action before the 
second (or subsequent) attack roll is made. 

Take, for example, a fighter who can 
attack twice per round, and say he’s battling 
creatures that can only make one attack. 
The fighter wins initiative. He makes his 
first attack according to the rolled initiative 
order. Then each creature gets its attack. 
Finally, the fighter gets his second attack. 

If fighters on both sides in a battle were 
able to attack twice in the round, their first 
attacks would occur according to the initia- 
tive roll. Their second attacks would come 
after all other attacks, and would then alter- 
nate according to the initiative roll. 


Combat (Two Weapons) 


Spellcasting and Initiative 


Casting times for 
spells can modify initiative rolls, creating a 
realistic delay for the spellcaster. When a 
spell’s “Casting Time” parameter is given as 
a number without any units (e.g., rounds or 
turns), then that number is added to the 
caster’s initiative roll to determine his modi- 
fied initiative. When a spell requires a round 
or more to cast, a normal initiative roll is 
not made—a spell requiring one round to 
cast takes effect at the end of the current 
round, after all other actions are completed. 
Spells that require more than one round 
to cast involve some bookkeeping. The DM 
or one of the players must keep track of the 
rounds spent in casting. If the spellcasting 
character is disturbed during this time, the 
spell is lost. If all goes well, the spell takes 
effect at the very end of the last round of the 
required casting time. Thus, a spell requir- 
ing 10 minutes to cast would require 10 
combat rounds, and wouldn't take effect 
until the very end of the 10th round. 


Weapon Speed and Initiative 
(Optional Rule) 

Each time a char- 
acter swings a weapon, he places himself 
out of position to make his next attack. 
Swinging a hammer is not as simple as tap- 
ping in a nail. A war hammer is heavy. 
Swing it in one direction and it pulls in that 
direction. It has to be brought under con- 
trol and repositioned before it can be 
swung again. The user must regain his bal- 
ance and plant his feet firmly. Only after 
doing all this is he ready for his next attack. 

Compare how quickly someone can 
throw a punch to the amount of time re- 
quired to swing a chair to get a good idea 
of what weapon speed factors are about. 

Weapon speed factors slow the speed 
of a character's attack. The higher the 
weapon speed factor, the heavier, clum- 
sier, or more limited the weapon is. For 
the most part, weapon speed factors ap- 
ply to all creatures using manufactured 
weapons, The speed factor of a weapon 
is added to the initiative roll of the char- 
acter to get his modified initiative roll. 

Thus, if the DM decides to use weapon 
speed factors for player characters, they 
should also be used for giants, orcs, cen- 
taurs, and the like. Otherwise the DM 
isn’t being fair to the players. However, 
creatures with natural weapons are not 
affected by weapon speed. Their attacks 
are natural extensions of their bodies, 
giving them much faster recovery and re- 
action times. 


Magical Weapon Speeds 

Magical weapons are easier to wield in 
combat than ordinary ones. Maybe the 
weapon is lighter or better balanced than 
normal; maybe it just pulls the character 
into the proper position of its own voli- 
tion, Whatever the cause, each bonus 
point conferred by a weapon re- 
duces the speed factor of that weapon by 
1. (A sword +3 reduces the weapon 
speed factor by 3, for example.) When a 
weapon has two bonuses, the lesser one 
is used. No weapon can have a speed fac- 
tor of less than 0. 


Attacking with 
Two Weapons 


A tricky fighting 
style available only to warriors and rogues 
is that of fighting with two weapons simul- 
taneously. The character chooses not to use 
a shield in favor of another weapon, grant- 
ing him a greater number of attacks, with a 
penalty to his attack rolls (rangers are ex- 
empt from the attack roll penalty). 

When using a second weapon in his off- 
hand, a character is limited in his weapon 
choice. His principal weapon can be what- 
ever he chooses, provided it can be wielded 
with one hand. The second weapon must be 
smaller in size and weight than the charac- 
ter's main weapon (though a dagger can al- 
ways be used as a second weapon, even if 
the primary weapon is also a dagger). A 
fighter can use a long sword and a short 
sword, or along sword and a dagger, but he 
cannot use two long swords, Nor can the 
character use a shield, unless it is kept 
strapped onto his back. 

When attacking, all characters but rang- 
ers suffer penalties to their attack rolls. At- 
tacks made with the main weapon suffer a 
~2 penalty, and attacks made with the sec- 
ond weapon suffer a —4 penalty. The char- 
acter’s Reaction Adjustment (based on his 
Dexterity, see Table 2) modifies this penalty. 
A low Dexterity score will worsen the char- 
acter’s chance to hit with each attack. A 
high Dexterity can negate this particular 
penalty, although it cannot result in a posi- 
tive modifier on the attack rolls for either 
weapon (i.e., the Reaction Adjustment can, 
at best, raise the attack roll penalties to 0). 

The use of two weapons enables the char- 
acter to make one additional attack each 
combat round, with the second weapon. 
The character gains only one additional at- 
tack each round, regardless of the number 
of attacks he may normally be allowed. 
Thus a warrior able to attack 3/2 (once in 
the first round and twice in the second) can 
attack 5/2 (twice in the first round and three 
times in the second).

Movement in Combat 


Since a round is 
roughly a minute long, it should be easy for 
a character to move just about anywhere he 
wants during the course of the round. After 
all, Olympic-class sprinters can cover vast 
amounts of ground in a minute. 

However, a character in an AD&D® game 
is not an Olympic sprinter running in a 
straight line. He is trying to maneuver 
through a battle without getting killed. He is 
keeping his eyes open for trouble, avoiding 
surprise, watching his back, watching the 
backs of his partners, and looking for a 
good opening, while simultaneously plan- 
ning his next move, sometimes through a 
haze of pain. He may be carrying a load of 
equipment that slows him down signifi- 
cantly. Because of all these things, the dis- 
tance a character can move is significantly 
less than players generally think. 

In a combat round, a being can move up 
to 10 times its movement rating (see Chap- 
ter 14) in feet. Thus, if a character has a 
movement rating of 9, he can move up to 90 
feet in a round. However, the types of 
moves a character can make during combat 
are somewhat limited. 


Movement in Melee 


The basic move is 
to get closer for combat—i.e., move close 
enough to an enemy to attack. This is nei- 
ther a blind rush nor a casual stroll. Instead, 
the character approaches quickly but with 
caution. When closing for combat, a char- 
acter can move up to half his allowed dis- 
tance and still make a melee attack. 


Movement and Missile Combat 


Rather than slug it 
out toe to toe with an opponent, a character 
can move up to one-half his normal move- 
ment rate and engage in missile fire at half 
his normal rate of fire. Thus a man capable 
of moving 120 feet and armed with a long 
bow (two shots per round, under normal 
circumstances) could move 60 feet and still 
fire one shot. The same man, armed with a 
heavy crossbow (one shot every other 
round) would be able to shoot only once 
every four rounds while on the move. 


Charging an Opponent 


A character can 
also charge a foe. A charge increases the 
character's movement rate by 50% and en- 
ables the character to make an attack at the 
end of his movement. A charging character 
also gains a +2 bonus to his attack roll, 
mainly from momentum. Certain weapons 
(such as a lance) inflict double the rolled 
damage in a charge. 


However, charging gives the opponents 
several advantages. First, they gain a —2 
bonus to their initiative rolls. Second, 
charging characters gain no Dexterity bo- 
nuses to Armor Class and they suffer an AC 
penalty of 1. Finally, if the defender is using 
a spear or polearm weapon and sets it 
against the charge (bracing the butt against 
a stone or his foot), he inflicts double dam- 
age on a successful hit. 


Retreat 


To get out of acom- 
bat, characters can make a careful with- 
drawal or they can simply flee. 

Withdrawing: When making a with- 
drawal, a character carefully backs away 
from his opponent (who can choose to fol- 
low). The character moves up to 1/3 his nor- 
mal movement rate. 

If two characters are fighting a single op- 
ponent and one of them decides to with- 
draw, the remaining character can block the 
advance of the opponent. This is a useful 
method for getting a seriously injured man 
out of a combat. 

Fleeing: To flee from combat, a character 
simply turns and runs up to his full move- 
ment rate. However, the fleeing character 
drops his defenses and turns his back to his 
opponent. 

The enemy is allowed a free attack (or 
multiple attacks if the creature has several 
attacks per round) at the rear of the fleeing 
character. This attack is made the instant 
the character flees: It doesn’t count against 
the number of attacks that opponent is al- 
lowed during the round, and initiative is ir- 
relevant. 

The fleeing character can be pursued, un- 
less a companion blocks the advance of the 
enemy. 


Attacking Without Killing 


There are times 
when a character wants to defeat another 
being without killing it. A companion may 
have been charmed into attacking his 
friends (and his friends don’t want to kill 
him to save themselves!); an enemy may 
have information the PCs can get only by 
subduing him; characters may simply see 
the monetary value of bringing back a real, 
live monster. Whatever the case, sooner or 
later characters are going to try. 

There are three types of nonlethal 
attacks—punching, wrestling, and over- 
bearing. Punching is basic bare-fisted fight- 
ing. Wrestling is the classic combination of 
grappling, holds, and throws. Overbearing 
is simply trying to pull down an opponent 
by sheer mass or weight of numbers, pin- 
ning him to the ground. 


Punching and Wrestling 


These are the most 
basic of combat skills, unknowingly prac- 
ticed by almost all children as they rough 
and tumble with each other. Thus all char- 
acters, regardless of class, are assumed to be 
somewhat proficient in both these forms of 
fighting. 

Punching occurs when a character attacks 
with his fists. No weapons are used, al- 
though the character can wear an iron 
gauntlet or similar item. Wrestling requires 
both hands free, unencumbered by shields 
and the like. 

When punching or wrestling, a normal at- 
tack roll is made. The normal Armor Class 
of the target is used. If a character is at- 
tempting to wrestle in armor, the modifiers 
on Table 57 are used (these are penalties to 
the attacker's attack roll). Normal modifiers 
to the attack roll are also applied. 

Penalties for being held or attacking a 
held opponent do not apply to wrestlers. 


Wrestling involves a lot of holding and 
twisting as it is, and the damage resolution 
system for punching and wrestling takes this 
into account.

If the attack roll is successful, consult Ta- 
ble 58 to find the result of the attack: Cross- 
index the character's modified attack roll 
with the proper attack form. If, for exam- 
ple, a character successfully punched with 
an 18, the result would be a rabbit punch (if 
he rolled an 18 on a successful wrestling at- 
tempt, the result would be a kick). Punching 
and wrestling attacks can succeed on attack 
rolls of 1 or less (exceptions to the general 
rule).

Combat (Touch Spells) 


Punch: This is the type of blow landed. In 
game terms, the type of blow has little 
effect, but using the names adds spice to the 
battle and makes the DM's job of describing 
the action easier. 

Damage: Bare-handed attacks cause only 
1 or 2 points of damage. Metal gauntlets, 
brass knuckles, and the like cause 1d3 
points of damage. A character's Strength 
bonus, if any, does apply to punching 
attacks. 

Punching damage is handled a little dif- 
ferently than normal damage. Only 25% of 
the damage caused by a bare-handed attack 
is normal damage. The remaining 75% is 
temporary. For the sake of convenience, 
record punching damage separately from 
other damage and calculate the percentage 
split at the end of all combat. 

If a character reaches 0 hit points due to 
punching attacks (or any combination of 
punching and normal attacks), he immedi- 
ately falls unconscious. 

A character can voluntarily pull his 
punch, not causing any hit point damage, 
provided he says so before the damage is 
applied to his enemy. There is still a chance 
of a knockout. 

% K.O.: Although a punch does very lit- 
tle damage, there is a chance of knocking an 
opponent out. This chance is listed on the 
table as “% K.O.” If this number or less is 
rolled on percentile dice, the victim is 
stunned for 1d10 rounds. 

Wrestle: This lists the action or type of 
grip the character managed to get. Wres- 
tling moves marked with an asterisk (*) are 
holds maintained from round to round, 
unless they are broken. A hold is broken by 
a throw, a gouge, the assistance of another 
person, or the successful use of a weapon. 
(Penalties to the attack roll apply to weapon 
attacks by a character who is in a hold.) 

All wrestling moves inflict 1 point of 
damage plus Strength bonus (if the attacker 
desires), while continued holds cause cumu- 
latively 1 more point of damage for each 
round they are held. A head lock held for six 
rounds would inflict 21 points of damage 
total (1+2+3+4+5+6). Remember, this is 
the equivalent of pressing hard on a full- 
nelson headlock for roughly six minutes! 


Overbearing 

Sometimes the most 
effective attack is simply to pull an oppo- 
nent down by sheer numbers. No attempt is 
made to gain a particular hold or even to 
harm the victim. The only concern is to pin 
and restrain him. 

To overbear an opponent, a normal 
attack roll is made. For every level of size 
difference (1 if a Large attacker takes on a 
Medium defender, for example), the attack 
roll is modified by 4 (+4 if the attacker is 
larger; —4 if the defender is larger). 


The defender also gains a benefit if it has 
more than two legs: a —2 penalty to the 
attacker's roll for every leg beyond two. 
There is no penalty to the defender if it has 
no legs. A lone orc attempting to pull down 
a horse and rider would have at least a —8 
penalty applied to the attack roll (—4 for 
size and —4 for the horse's four legs). 

If the attack succeeds, the opponent is 
pulled down. A character can be pinned if 
further successful overbearing attacks are 
rolled each round. For pinning purposes, do 
not use the prone modifier to combat (from 
Table 51). 

If multiple attackers are all attempting to 
pull down a single target, make only one 
attack roll with a +1 bonus for each attack- 
er beyond the first. Always use the to-hit 
number of the weakest attacker to figure the 
chance of success, since cooperation always 
depends on the weakest link. Modifiers for 
size should be figured for the largest attack- 
er of the group. 

A giant and three pixies attempting to 
pull down a man would use the pixies’ 
attack roll, modified by +3 for three extra 
attackers and +8 for the size difference of 
the giant (Huge) and the man (Medium). 


Weapons in Non-Lethal Combat 


As you might ex- 
pect, weapons have their place in non-lethal 
combat, whether a character is defending or 
pressing the attack. 

Weapons in Defense: A character 
attempting to punch, wrestle, or overbear 
an armed opponent can do so only by plac- 
ing himself at great risk. Making matters 
worse, an armed defender is automatically 
allowed to strike with his weapon before the 
unarmed attack is made, regardless of the 
initiative die roll. Furthermore, since his 
opponent must get very close, the defender 
gains a +4 bonus to his attack and damage 
rolls, If the attacker survives, he can then 
attempt his attack. 

Those involved in a wrestling bout are 
limited to weapons of small size after the 
first round of combat—it's very difficult to 
use a sword against someone who is twist- 
ing your sword arm or clinging to your 
back, trying to break your neck. For this 
reason, nearly all characters will want to 
carry a dagger or a knife. 

Non-Lethal Weapon Attacks: It is possi- 
ble to make an armed attack without caus- 
ing serious damage (striking with the flat of 
the blade, for example). This is not as easy 
as it sounds, however. 

First, the character must be using a weap- 
on that enables him to control the damage 
he inflicts. This is impossible with an arrow 
or sling. It isn’t even feasible with a war 
hammer or mace. It can be done with 
swords and axes, as long as the blade can be 
turned so it doesn’t cut. 


98 


Second, the character has a —4 penalty to 
his attack roll, since handling a weapon in 
this way is clumsier than usual. The damage 
from such an attack is 50% normal; one- 
half of this damage is temporary. 


Non-Lethal Combat and Creatures 


When dealing with 
non-humanoid opponents, a number of fac- 
tors must be considered. 

First, unintelligent creatures, as a rule, 
never try to grapple, punch, or pull down 
an opponent. They cheerfully settle for tear- 
ing him apart, limb by limb. This, to their 
small and animalistic minds, is a better solu- 
tion. 

Second, the natural weapons of a creature 
are always usable. Unlike men with swords, 
a lion or a carnivorous ape doesn’t lose the 
use of its teeth and fangs just because a char- 
acter is very close to it. 

Finally, and of greatest importance, crea- 
tures tend to be better natural fighters than 
humans. All attacks for a tiger are the same 
as punching or wrestling. It’s just that the 
tiger has claws! Furthermore, a tiger can use 
all of its legs effectively—front and back. 


Touch Spells and Combat 


Many spells used 
by priests and wizards take effect only when 
the target is touched by the caster. Under 
normal circumstances, this is no problem— 
the spellcaster reaches out and touches the 
recipient. However, if the target is unwill- 
ing, or the spell is used in the midst of a gen- 
eral melee, the situation is much different. 

Unwilling Targets: The spellcaster must 
make a successful attack roll for the spell to 
have any effect. The wizard or priest calcu- 
lates his to-hit number normally, according 
to the intended victim’s Armor Class and 
other protections. The DM can modify the 
roll if the victim is unprepared for or 
unaware of the attack. If the roll succeeds, 
the spellcaster touches the target and the 
normal spell effect occurs. 

Willing Targets: When attempting to cast 
a spell on a willing target, the casting is 
automatic as long as both characters are not 
engaged in combat. For example, if a fighter 
withdraws from melee, a cleric could heal 
him the next round. 

If the recipient of the spell attempts to do 
anything besides waiting for the spell to 
take effect, an attack roll against AC 10 
must be made. However, no AC modifiers 
for Dexterity are applied, since the target is 
not trying to avoid the spell! 

Whenever a touch spell is successful, the 
spellcaster suffers from any special defenses 
of his target, if they are continually in oper- 
ation. A successful touch to a vampire 
would not result in energy drain, since the 
power only works when the vampire wills 


Combat (Missile Weapons) 


it, but touching a fire elemental would result 
in serious burns. 

When a touch spell is cast, it normally re- 
mains effective only for that round. How- 
ever, certain spells do specify special 
conditions or durations. Be sure to check 
each spell description carefully. 


Missile Weapons 
in Combat 


In general, missile 
combat is handled identically to standard 
melee. Intentions are announced, initiative 
is rolled, and attack rolls are made. How- 
ever, there are some special rules and situa- 
tions that apply only to missile combat. 

Missile weapons are divided into two gen- 
eral categories. The first includes all stand- 
ard, direct-fire, single-target missiles 
—slings, arrows, quarrels, spears, throwing 
axes, and the like. 

The second category includes all grenade- 
like missiles that have an area effect, no 
matter how small. Thus an attack with these 
weapons does not have to hit its target di- 
rectly to have a chance of affecting it. In- 
cluded in this group are small flasks of oil, 
acid, poison, holy water, potions, and boul- 
ders. Hurled boulders are included because 
they bounce and bound along after they hit, 
leaving a swath of destruction. 


The first step in 
making a missile attack is to find the range 
from the attacker to the target. This is mea- 
sured in yards from one point to the other. 
This distance is compared to the range cate- 
gories for the weapon used (see Table 45 in 
Chapter 6). 

If the distance is greater than the long 
range given, the target is out of range; if the 
distance is between the long- and medium- 
range numbers, the target is at long range; 
when between the medium- and short-range 
numbers, medium range is used; when equal 
to or less than the short-range distance, the 
target is at short range. 

Short-range attacks suffer no range modi- 
fier. Medium-range attacks suffer a —2 pen- 
alty to the attack roll. Long-range attacks 
suffer a —5 penalty. Some weapons have no 
short range since they must arc a certain dis- 
tance before reaching their target. These at- 
tacks are always made with an attack roll 
penalty. 


Rate of Fire 


Bows, crossbows, 
and many other missile weapons have dif- 
ferent rates of fire (ROF)—the number of 
missiles they can shoot in a single round. 

Small, light weapons can be thrown very 


quickly, so up to three darts can be thrown 
in a single round. Arrows can be nocked 
and let loose almost as quickly, so up to two 
shots can be fired in a single round. 

Some weapons (such as heavy crossbows) 
take a long time to load and can be fired 
only every other round. 

Whatever the ROF, multiple missile shots 
are handled the same way as other multiple 
attacks for the purposes of determining ini- 
tiative. The ROF of each missile weapon is 
listed in table 45 in Chapter 6. 


Ability Modifiers in Missile Combat 


Attack rol] and dam- 
damage modifiers for Strength are always 
used when an attack is made with a hurled 
weapon. Here the power of the character's 
arm is a significant factor in the effective- 
ness of the attack. 

When using a bow, the attack roll and 
damage Strength modifiers apply only if the 
character has a properly prepared bow (see 
Chapter 6: Money and Equipment). Char- 
acters never receive Strength bonuses when 
using crossbows or similar mechanical de- 
vices. 

Dexterity modifiers to the attack roll are 
applied when making a missile attack with a 
hand-held weapon. Thus, a character adds 
his Dexterity modifier when using a bow, 
crossbow, or axe but not when firing a tre- 
buchet or other siege engine. 


Firing into a Melee 


Missile weapons 
are intended mainly as long-range weapons. 
Ideally, they are used before the opponents 
reach your line. However, ideal situations 
are all too rare, and characters often dis- 
cover that the only effective way to attack is 
to shoot arrows (or whatever) at an enemy 
already in melee combat with their compan- 
ions. While possible, and certainly allowed, 
this is a risky proposition. 

When missiles are fired into a melee, the 
DM counts the number of figures in the im- 
mediate area of the intended target. Each 
Medium figure counts as 1. Small (S) figures 
count as '/2, Large as 2, Huge as 4, and Gar- 
gantuan as 6. The total value is compared to 
the value of each character or creature in the 
target melee. Using this ratio, the DM rolls a 
die to determine who (or what) will be the 
target of the shot. 


For example, Tarus Bloodheart (man-size, 
or I point) and Rath (also man-size, or I 
point) are fighting a giant (size G, 6 points) 
while Thule fires a long bow at the giant. 
The total value of all possible targets is 8 
(6+1+1), There's a 1 in 8 chance that Rath 
is the target; a1 in 8 chance that Tarus is hit; 
and a 6 in 8 chance the shot hits the giant. 


99 


The DM could roll an 8-sided die to deter- 
mine who gets hit, or he could reduce the ra- 
tios to a percentage (75% chance the giant is 
hit, etc.) and roll percentile dice. 


Taking Cover Against Missile Fire 


One of the best 
ways to avoid being hit and injured is to 
hide behind something—a wall, a tree, a 
building corner, a heap of boulders, or 
whatever happens to be available. Profes- 
sional adventurers, wishing to make this 
sound heroic, call this taking cover. 

Taking cover doesn't work particularly 
well in a melee, since the cover hampers de- 
fender and attacker equally. However, it is 
quite an effective tactic against missile fire. 

There are two types of protection a char- 
acter can have. The first is concealment, 
also called soft cover. A character hiding be- 
hind a clump of bushes is concealed. He can 
be seen, but only with difficulty, and it's no 
easy task to determine exactly where he is. 
The bushes cannot stop an arrow, but they 
do make it less likely that the character is 
hit. Other types of concealment include cur- 
tains, tapestries, smoke, fog, and brambles. 

The other type of protection is cover, 
sometimes called, more precisely, hard 
cover. lt is, as its name implies, something a 
character can hide behind that will block a 
missile. Hard cover includes stone walls, the 
corner of a building, tables, doors, earth 
embankments, tree trunks, and magical 
walls of force. 

Cover helps a potential target by giving 
the attacker a negative modifier to his at- 
tack roll. The exact modifier for conceal- 
ment or cover depends on the degree to 
which it is being used as shelter. A character 
who stands behind a two-foot wall is a 
pretty obvious target, especially when com- 
pared to the character who lies down behind 
that wall and carefully peers over it. Table 
59 lists the different modifiers for varying 
degrees of cover and concealment. 


Table 59: COVER AND CONCEALMENT 


MODIFIERS 
Target is: Cover Concealment 
25% hidden = =1 
50% hidden -4 =! 
75% hidden =7 = 
90% hidden -10 i! 


Cover also has an affect on saving 
throws, granting the character the modifier 
listed on Table 59 as a bonus to his saving 
throws against spells that cause physical 
damage (e.g., fireball, lightning bolt, etc.). 

Furthermore, a character who has 90% 
cover (or more) suffers one-half normal 
damage on a failed save and no damage at 
all if a saving throw is successful. This 


Combat (Parrying) 


assumes, of course, that the fireball, light- 
ning bolt, or whatever, hit the cover—a 
man crouching behind a stone wall would 
be protected if a fireball exploded in front of 
the wall, but would not be protected by cov- 
er if the blast occurred behind him, on his 
side of the wall. 


Grenade-Like Missiles 


Unlike standard 
missiles, which target a specific creature, a 
grenade-like missile is aimed at a point, 
whether this point is a creature or a spot on 
the ground. When the attack is announced, 
the player indicates where he wants the mis- 
sile to land. This then becomes the target 
point and is used to determine the direction 
and distance of any scatter. 

Most grenade-like missiles are items of 
opportunity or necessity—rocks, flasks of 
oil, vials of holy water, or beakers of acid. 
As such, these items are not listed on the 
equipment tables for range, ROF, and dam- 
age. The range each can be thrown varies 
with the Strength of the character and the 
weight of the object. 

A missile of five pounds or less can be 
thrown about 30 feet. Short range is 10 feet, 
medium range is 20 feet, and everything 
beyond is maximum range. Heavier items 
have reduced ranges. Just how far an object 
can be thrown is decided by the DM. 

Exceptionally heavy items can be thrown 
only if the character rolls a successful bend 
bars/lift gates check. In no case can a char- 
acter throw an item heavier than his 
Strength would allow him to lift. Thus, the 
DM can rule that a character would have lit- 
tle trouble chucking a half-empty backpack 
across a ten-foot chasm, but the character 
would need to make a check in order to 
heave an orc ten feet through the air into the 
faces of his orcish friends. 

Once a container hits, it normally breaks 
immediately. However, this is not always 
true. Some missiles, like soft leather flasks 
or hard pottery, are particularly resistant. If 
there’s some doubt about whether or not a 
thrown object will break, the DM can 
require an item saving throw (this informa- 
tion is in the DMG) to see if it shatters or 
rips, spewing its contents everywhere. 

The DMG contains information on how 
to resolve the inevitable situations in which 
grenade-like missiles miss their targets. 


Types of Grenade-Like Missiles 


Acid damage is par- 
ticularly grim. Aside from the possibility of 
scarring (which is left to the DM), acid dam- 
age cannot be healed by regeneration. It 
must be healed normally. Thus it is very use- 
ful against regenerating creatures such as 
trolls. Acid is very rare. 

Holy Water affects most forms of undead 


and creatures from the lower planes. It has 
no effect against a creature in gaseous form 
or undead without material form. 

Unholy water (essentially holy water 
used by evil priests) affects paladins, crea- 
tures whose purpose is to defend good (lam- 
masu, shedu, etc.), and creatures and beings 
from the upper planes. 

Holy (or unholy) water affects creatures 
as does acid, causing damage that cannot be 
regenerated but must be healed normally. 

Oil causes damage only when it is lit. This 
normally requires a two-step process—first 
soaking the target in flammable oil and then 
setting it afire. Thus using flaming oil often 
requires two successful attacks. 

A direct hit from flaming oil burns for 
two rounds, causing 2d6 points of damage 
in the first round and 1d6 points in the sec- 
ond round. 

Poison is generally not very effective as a 
missile weapon. Most poisons take effect 
only if the missile scores a direct hit, and 
even then only if it drops into the gaping 
maw of some huge creature. Contact poi- 
sons have normal poison effects on a direct 
hit. The DM has information about specific 
poison effects in the DMG. 


Special Defenses 


So far, the bulk of this 
chapter has dealt with ways to attack. Now, 
it’s time to turn to defense. There are several 
ways to avoid taking damage. Two of the 
most common are the saving throw and 
magic resistance. Somewhat less common, 
because its use is limited to clerics and pala- 
dins, is the ability to turn undead.

instance), his chance of being hit

In order to make himself harder to hit, 


The Saving Throw 


The saving throw is 
a die roll that gives a chance, however slim, 
that the character or creature finds some 
way to save himself from certain destruc- 
tion (or at least lessen the damage of a suc- 
cessful attack), 

More often than not, the saving throw 
represents an instinctive act on the part of 
the character—diving to the ground just as a 
fireball scorches the group, blanking the 
mind just as a mental battle begins; blocking 
the worst of an acid spray with a shield. The 
exact action is not important—DMs and 
players can think of lively and colorful 
explanations of why a saving throw suc- 
ceeded or failed. Explanations tailored to 
the events of the moment enhance the 
excitement of the game. 


Rolling Saving Throws 


To make a saving 
throw, a player rolls a 20-sided die (1d20). 
The result must be equal to or greater than 
the character's saving throw number, The 
number a character needs to roll varies 
depending upon the character's group, his 
level, and what the character is trying to 
save himself from. A character's saving 
throw numbers can be found in Table 60. 

Saving throws are made in a variety of 
situations: For attacks involving paralyza- 
tion, poison, or death magic; petrification 
or polymorph; rod, staff, or wand; breath 
weapon; and spells. The type of saving 
throw a character must roll is determined by 
the specific spell, monster, magical item, or 
situation involved. 

Monsters also use Table 60. The DM has 
specific information about monster saving 
throws.

* Excluding polymorph wand attacks. 


** Excluding those that cause petrification or polymorph. 
*** Excluding those for which another saving throw type is specified, such as death, petrifica- 


tion, polymorph, etc. 


Saving Throw Priority 


Sometimes the type 
of saving throw required by a situation or 
item isn’t clear, or more than one category 
of saving throw may seem appropriate. For 
this reason, the saving throw categories in 
Table 60 are listed in order of importance, 
beginning with paralyzation, poison, and 
death magic, and ending with spells. 

Imagine that Rath is struck by the ray 
from a wand of polymorphing. Both a sav- 
ing throw vs. wands and a saving throw vs. 
polymorph would be appropriate. But Rath 
must rol] a saving throw vs. wands because 
that category has a higher priority than 
polymorph. 

The categories of saving throws are as fol- 
lows: 

Save vs. Paralyzation, Poison, and Death 
Magic: This is used whenever a character is 
affected by a paralyzing attack (regardless 
of source), poison (of any strength), or cer- 
tain spells and magical items that otherwise 
kill the character outright (as listed in their 
descriptions). This saving throw can also be 
used in situations in which exceptional force 


of will or physical fortitude are needed. 

Save vs. Rod, Staff, or Wand: As its name 
implies, this is used whenever a character is 
affected by the powers of a rod, staff, or 
wand, provided another save of higher pri- 
ority isn’t called for. This saving throw is 
sometimes specified for situations in which 
a character faces a magical attack from an 
unusual source. 

Save vs. Petrification or Polymorph: This 
is used any time a character is turned to 
stone (petrified) or polymorphed by a mon- 
ster, spell, or magical item (other than a 
wand). It can also be used when the charac- 
ter must withstand some massive physical 
alteration of his entire body. 

Save vs. Breath Weapon: A character uses 
this save when facing monsters with breath 
weapons, particularly the powerful blast of 
a dragon. This save can also be used in situ- 
ations where a combination of physical 
stamina and Dexterity are critical factors in 
survival. 

Save vs. Spell: This is used whenever a 
character attempts to resist the effects of a 
magical attack, either by a spellcaster or 
from a magical item, provided no other type 


101 


of saving throw is specified. This save can 
also be used to resist an attack that defies 
any other classification. 


Voluntarily Failing Saving Throws 


No save is made if 
the target voluntarily chooses not to resist 
the effect of a spell or special attack. This is 
the case even if the character was duped as 
to the exact nature of the spell. When a char- 
acter announces that he is not resisting the 
spell’s power, that spell (or whatever) has its 
full effect. 

The intention not to resist must be clearly 
stated or set up through trickery, however. 
lf a character is attacked by surprise or 
caught unawares, he is normally allowed a 
saving throw. The DM can modify this sav- 
ing throw, making the chance of success 
worse, if the situation warrants it. Only in 
extreme cases of trickery and deception 
should an unwitting character be denied a 
saving throw. 


Ability Checks as Saving Throws 


When a character 
attempts to avoid danger through the use of 
one of his abilities, an ability check can be 
used in lieu of a saving throw. 

For example, Ragnar the thief has broken 
into someone's home when he hears a grat- 
ing noise from the ceiling above him. He 
looks up to find a five-ton block of the ceil- 
ing headed straight for him! He is going to 
need speedy reactions to get out of the way, 
so a Dexterity ability check should be rolled 
to see if he avoids the trap. 


Modifying Saving Throws 


Saving throws can 
be modified by magical items, specific rules, 
and special situations. These modifiers can 
increase or decrease the chance of a success- 
ful saving throw. 

Modifiers that increase the chance are 
given as a number preceded by a plus sign. 
Modifiers that make success more difficult 
are given as a number preceded by a minus 
sign (—1, —2, etc.). 

Saving throw modifiers affect a charac- 
ter's die roll, not the saving throw number 
needed. Thus, if Delsenora needed an 11 for 
a successful saving throw vs. petrification 
and had a +1 bonus to her save, she would 
still need to roll an 11 or higher after all ad- 
justments were made (but the +1 bonus 
would be added to her die roll, so that effec- 
tively she needs to roll only a 10 on the die 
to reach her saving throw number of 11), 

High ability scores in Dexterity and Wis- 
dom sometimes give saving throw bonuses. 
A high Wisdom protects against illusions, 
charms, and other mental attacks. Dexter- 
ity, if high enough, can give a character a 


Combat (Magic Resistance) 


slightly higher chance of avoiding the effects 
of fireballs, lightning bolts, crushing boul- 
ders, and other attacks where nimbleness 
may be a help. (See Tables 2 and 5.) 

Magical items like cloaks and rings of 
protection give bonuses to a character's sav- 
ing throw (these are listed in the item 
descriptions in the DMG). 

Magical armor allows a saving throw 
bonus only when the save is made necessary 
by something physical, whether normal or 
magical; magical armor never gives a saving 
throw bonus against gas (which it cannot 
block), poison (which operates internally), 
and spells that are mental in nature or that 
cause no physical damage. 

For example, magical armor would not 
help a character's saving throw against the 
sting of a giant scorpion, the choking effects 
of a stinking cloud spell, or the transforma- 
tion effect of a polymorph others spell. 
Magical armor does extend its protective 
power to saving throws against acid sprays 
or splashes, disintegration, magical and 
normal fires, spells that cause damage, and 
falls (if any saving throw is allowed in this 
case). Other situations must be handled ona 
case-by-case basis by the DM. 

Specific spells and magical items have 
effects, both good and ill, on a character's 
saving throws. Often, spells force the victim 
to save with a penalty, which makes even 
the most innocuous spell quite dangerous. 
(Specific information can be found in the 
spell descriptions, for spells, or in the 
DMG’‘s Magical Items section, for magical 
items.) 

Minor poisons of verminous creatures 
such as giant centipedes, while dangerous, 
are weak and unlikely to bring about death 
in a healthy man. To recreate this effect in 
the game, a saving throw bonus is allowed 
for anyone affected by these poisons. The 
DM has this information. 

Unpredictable situations are sure to crop 
up. When this happens, the DM must deter- 
mine whether saving throw modifiers are 
appropriate. As a guideline, modifiers for 
situations should range from —4 to +4. An 
evil cleric attacked in his shrine could very 
well have a +3 bonus to all his saving 
throws and a —3 penalty applied to those of 
his enemies. The powerful evil of the place 
could warrant the modifier. 


Magic Resistance 


Some creatures or 
items strongly resist the effects of magic (or 
impart such resistance to others). This 
makes them more difficult to affect with 
magical energy than ordinary creatures or 
items. 

A rare few creatures are extremely anti- 
magical—magic rolls off them like water off 
a duck’s back. More common are creatures, 
especially from the outer planes of exist- 


ence, that live in enchanted or sorcerous 
lands and are filled with powerful magical 
energies. These creatures eat and breathe 
the vapors of wizardry, and they have a 
high tolerance against arcane power. 

Magic resistance is an innate ability—that 
is, the possessor does not have to do any- 
thing special to use it. The creature need not 
even be aware of the threat for his magic 
resistance to operate. Such resistance is part 
of the creature or item and cannot be sepa- 
rated from it. (Creatures, however, can vol- 
untarily lower their magic resistance at 
will.) 

Magic resistance is also an individual 
ability. A creature with magic resistance 
cannot impart this power to others by hold- 
ing their hands or standing in their midst. 
Only the rarest of creatures and magical 
items have the ability to bestow magic 
resistance upon another. 

Magic resistance is given as a percentile 
number. For a magical effect to have any 
chance of success, the magic resistance must 
be overcome. The target (the one with the 
magic resistance) rolls percentile dice. If the 
roll is higher than the creature's magic resist- 
ance, the spell has a normal effect. If the roll 
is equal to or less than the creature's magic 
resistance, the spell has absolutely no effect 
on the creature. 


Effects of Magic Resistance 

Magic resistance en- 
ables a creature to ignore the effects of spells 
and spell-like powers. It does not protect the 
creature from magical weapon attacks or 
from natural forces that may be a direct or 
accidental result of a spell. Nor does it pre- 
vent the protected creature from using his 
own abilities or from casting spells and 
using magical items. It can be effective 
against both individually targeted spells 
and, within limits, area-effect spells. 

If a magic resistance roll fails, and the 
spell has normal effect, the target can make 
all saving throws normally allowed against 
the spell. 


When Magic Resistance Applies 

Magic resistance ap- 
plies only if the successful casting of a spell 
would directly affect the resistant creature 
or item. Thus, magic resistance is effective 
against magic missile (targeted at a creature 
or item) or fireball (damaging the area the 
creature or item is in) spells. 

Magic resistance is not effective against 
an earthquake caused by a spell. While the 
creature may suffer injury or death falling 
into a chasm the spell opens under its feet, 
the magical energy of the spell was directed 
at the ground, not the creature. Magic 
resistant creatures are not immune to events 
that occur as the consequence of spells, only 


102 


to the direct energy created or released by a 


Player characters do not normally have 
magic resistance (though they still get sav- 
ing throws vs. magical spells and such); this 
ability is reserved mainly for special mon- 
sters. 


Successful Magic Resistance Rolls 


A successful magic 
resistance check can have four different 
results, depending on the nature of the spell 
being resisted: 

Individually Targeted Spells: By defini- 
tion, these spells affect just one creature, 
and only the targeted creature rolls for mag- 
ic resistance (if it has any). If a spell of this 
type is directed at several targets, each rolls 
independently of the others. (An example of 
this would be a hold person spell aimed at 
four creatures, with each creature getting a 
magic resistance roll, if they have magic 
resistance.) 

If the magic resistance roll is successful, 
the spell has no effect on that creature. If the 
spell is targeted only at the creature, the 
spell fails completely and disappears. If sev- 
eral targets are involved, the spell may still 
soe others who fail their magic resistance 
roll. 

Area-Effect Spells: These spells are not 
targeted ona single creature, but ona point. 
The spell’s effect encompasses everything 
within a set distance of that point. A suc- 
cessful magic resistance check enables the 
creature to ignore the effect of the spell. 
However, the spell is not negated and still 
applies to all others in the area of effect. 

In-Place Spells: These spells operate con- 
tinuously in a particular place or on a par- 
ticular creature, character, or item. Pro- 
tection from evil is one example of this kind 
of spell. 

Magic resistance comes into play only if a 
creature or item finds himself (or itself) in 
the place where the spell is in operation. 
Even then, magic resistance may not come 
into play—nothing happens if the spell isn’t 
of a type that affects the character. Thus, a 
part water spell would not collapse simply 
because a magic resistant creature walked 
through the area. A protection from evil 
spell, which could affect the creature, would 
be susceptible to magic resistance. 

If the DM determines that a magic resist- 
ance roll is appropriate, and the roll suc- 
ceeds, the in-place spell collapses (usually 
with a dramatic thunderclap and puff of 
smoke). 

Permanent Spells: Magic resistance is 
insufficient to destroy a permanent spell. 
Instead, the spell is negated (within the same 
guidelines given for in-place spells) for as 
long as the magic resistant creature is in the 
area of effect. 

Thus, a magic-resistant creature might be 


Combat (Turning Undead) 


able to step through a permanent wall of 
force as if it weren’t there. However, the 
wall would spring back into existence as 
soon as the creature passed through (i.e., no 
one else can pass through). 


Turning Undead 


One _ important, 
and potentially life-saving, combat ability 
available to priests and paladins is the abil- 
ity to turn undead. This is a special power 
granted by the character's deity. Druids can- 
not turn undead; priests of specific mythoi 
may be able to at the DM's option. 

Through the priest or paladin, the deity 
manifests a portion of its power, terrifying 
evil, undead creatures or blasting them right 
out of existence. However, since the power 
must be channeled through a mortal vessel, 
success is not always assured. 

When encountering undead, a priest or 
paladin can attempt to turn the creatures 
(remember that the paladin turns undead as 
if he was two levels lower—a Sth-level pala- 
din uses the level 3 column in Table 61). 
Only one attempt can be made per character 
per encounter, but several different charac-

To resolve a turning attempt, look on Ta- 
ble 61. Cross-index the Hit Dice or type of 
the undead with the level of the character 
(two levels lower for a paladin). If there is a 
number listed, roll 1d20. If the number 
rolled is equal to or greater than that listed, 
the attempt is successful. If the letter “T” 
(for “turned”) appears, the attempt is auto- 
matically successful without a die roll. If the 
letter “D” (for “dispel”) is given, the turning 
utterly destroys the undead. A dash (—) 
means that a priest or paladin of that level 
cannot turn that type of undead. A success- 
ful turn or dispel affects 2d6 undead. If the 
undead are a mixed group, the lowest Hit 
Dice creatures are turned first. 

Only one die is rolled regardless of the 
number of undead the character is attempt- 
ing to turn in a given round. The result is 
read individually for each type of undead. 

For example, Gorus, a 7th-level priest, 
and his party are attacked by two skeletons 
led by a wight and a spectre. The turning at- 
tempt is made, resulting in a roll of 12. 

Gorus’s player reads the table for all three 
types of undead using the same roll—12— 
for all three. The skeletons are destroyed (as 
Gorus knew they would be). The wight is

plane, certain Greater and Lesser Powers, and those undead that dwell in the outer planes. 

+ Paladins turn undead as priests who are two levels lower. 


ters can make attempts at the same time 
(with the results determined individually). 
Attempting to turn counts as an action, 
requiring one round and occurring during 
the character's turn in the initiative order 
(thus the undead may get to act before the 
character can turn them). The mere pres- 
ence of the character is not enough—a touch 
of drama from the character is important. 
Speech and gestures are important, so the 
character must have his hands free and be in 
a position to speak. However, turning is not 
like spellcasting and is not interrupted if the 
character is attacked during the attempt. 


turned (a 4 or better was needed) and flees. 
The spectre, however, continues forward 
undaunted (since a 16 was needed to turn 
the spectre). 

Turned undead bound by the orders of 
another (e.g., skeletons) simply retreat and 
allow the character and those with him to 
pass or complete their actions. 

Free-willed undead attempt to flee the 
area of the turning character, until out of his 
sight. If unable to escape, they circle at a dis- 
tance, no closer than ten feet to the charac- 
ter, provided he continues to maintain his 
turning (no further die rolls are needed). 


103 


If the character forces the free-willed un- 
dead to come closer than ten feet (by pressing 
them into a corner, for example) the turn- 
ing is broken and the undead attack nor- 
mally. 


Evil Priests and Undead 


Evil priests are nor- 
mally considered to be in league with undead 
creatures, or at least to share their aims and 
goals. Thus, they have no ability to turn un- 
dead. However, they can attempt to com- 
mand these beings. 

This is resolved in the same way as a turn- 
ing attempt. Up to 12 undead can be com- 
manded. A “T” result means the undead 
automatically obey the evil priest, while a “D” 
means the undead become completely subser- 
vient to the evil priest. They follow his com- 
mands (to the best of their ability and 
understanding) until turned, commanded, or 
destroyed by another. 

Evil priests also have the ability to affect 
paladins, turning them as if they were undead. 
However, since the living spirit of a paladin is 
far more difficult to quell and subvert, pala- 
dins are vastly more difficult to turn. 

An evil priest attempting to turn a paladin 
does so as if the priest were three levels lower 
than he actually is. Thus, a 7th-level evil priest 
would turn paladins on the 4th-level column. 
He would have only a slim chance of turning a 
7th-level paladin (7 HD) and would not be 
able to turn one of 8th level at all (using the 
level of the paladin as the HD to be turned). 
All “D” results against paladins are treated as 
“T" results. 


Injury and Death 


Sometimes, no de- 
gree of luck, skill, ability, or resistance to vari- 
ous attacks can prevent harm from coming to 
a character, The adventuring life carries with it 
unavoidable risks. Sooner or later a character 
is going to be hurt. 

To allow characters to be heroic (and for 
ease of play), damage is handled abstractly in 
the AD&D® game. All characters and mon- 
sters have a number of hit points. The more 
hit points a creature has, the harder it 
is to defeat. 

Damage is subtracted from a character's 
(or creature's) hit points. Should one of the 
player characters hit an ogre in the side of 
the head for 8 points of damage, those 8 
points are subtracted from the ogre’s total 
hit points. The damage isn’t applied to the 
head, or divided among different areas of 
the body. 

Hit point loss is cumulative until a character 
dies or has a chance to heal his wounds. 

Cwell the Fine, with 16 hit points, is injured 
by an orc that causes 3 points of dam- 
age. Fifteen minutes later, Cwell runs into a 


Combat (Special Damage) 


bugbear that inflicts 7 points of damage, Cwell 
has suffered 10 points of points of damage. 
This 10 points of damage remains until Cwell 
heals, either naturally or through magical 
means. 


Wounds 


When a character 
hits a monster, or vice versa, damage is suf- 
fered by the victim. The amount of damage 
depends on the weapon or method of attack. 
In Table 44 of Chapter 6, all weapons are rated 
for the amount of damage they inflict to 
Small, Medium, and Large targets. This is 
given as a die range (1d8, 2d6, etc.). 

Each time a hit is scored, the appropriate 
dice are rolled and the damage is subtracted 
from the current hit points of the target. An 
orc that attacks with a sword, for example, 
causes damage according to the information 
given for the type of sword it uses. A troll 
that bites once and rends with one of its 
clawed hands causes 2d6 points of damage 
with its bite and 1d4+4 points with its claw. 
(The DM gets this information from the 
Monstrous Compendium. ) 

Sometimes damage is listed as a die range 
along with a bonus of +1 or more. The 
troll’s claw attack, above, is a good exam- 
ple. This bonus may be due to high 
Strength, magical weapons, or the sheer fe- 
rocity of the creature's attack. The bonus is 
added to whatever number comes up on the 
die roll, assuring that some minimum 
amount of damage is caused. Likewise, pen- 
alties can also be applied, but no successful 
attack can result in less than 1 point of dam- 
age. 

Sometimes an attack has both a die roll 
and a damage multiplier. The number rolled 
on the dice is multiplied by the multiplier to 
determine how much damage is inflicted. 
This occurs mainly in backstabbing at- 
tempts. In cases where damage is multi- 
plied, only the base damage caused by the 
weapon is multiplied. Bonuses due to 
Strength or magic are not multiplied; they 
are added after the rolled damage is multi- 
plied. 


Special Damage 


Getting hit by wea- 
pons or monsters isn’t the only way a charac- 
ter can get hurt. Indeed, the world is full of 
dangers for poor, hapless player characters, 
dangers the DM can occasionally spring on 
them with glee. Some of the nastier forms of 
damage are described below. 


Falling 


Player characters 
have a marvelous (and, to the DM, vastly 
amusing) tendency to fall off things, gener- 
ally from great heights and almost always 


onto hard surfaces. While the falling is 
harmless, the abrupt stop at the end tends to 
cause damage. 

When a character falls, he suffers 1d6 
points of damage for every 10 feet fallen, to 
a maximum of 20d6 (which for game pur- 
poses can be considered terminal velocity). 

This method is simple and it provides all 
the realism necessary in the game. It is not a 
scientific calculation of the rate of accelera- 
tion, exact terminal velocity, mass, impact 
energy, etc., of the falling body. 

The fact of the matter is that physical 
laws may describe the exact motion of a 
body as it falls through space, but relatively 
little is known about the effects of impact. 
The distance fallen is not the only determin- 
ing factor in how badly a person is hurt. 
Other factors may include elasticity of the 
falling body and the ground, angle of im- 
pact, shock wave through the falling body, 
dumb luck, and more. 

People have actually fallen from great 
heights and survived, albeit very rarely. The 
current record-holder, Vesna Vulovic, sur- 
vived a fall from a height of 33,330 feet in 
1972, although she was severely injured. 
Flight-Sergeant Nicholas S. Alkemade actu- 
ally fell 18,000 feet—almost 3.5 miles— 
without a parachute and landed uninjured! 

The point of all this is roll the dice, as de- 
scribed above, and don’t worry too much 
about science. 


Paralysis 


A character or 
creature affected by paralysis becomes to- 
tally immobile for the duration of the spell’s 
effect. The victim can breathe, think, see, 
and hear, but he is unable to speak or move 
in any manner. Coherent thought needed to 
trigger magical items or innate powers is 
still possible. 

Paralysis affects only the general motor 
functions of the body and is not the ultimate 
destroyer of powerful creatures. It can be 
particularly potent on flying creatures, 
however. 

An Example of Paralysis: The adventur- 
ers encounter a beholder, a fearsome crea- 
ture with magical powers that emanate from 
its many eyes. 

After several rounds of combat, the par- 
ty’s priest casts a hold monster spell, para- 
lyzing the creature. The paralyzed beholder 
can still use the spell-like powers of its eyes 
and can still move about (since it levitates at 
will). But, on the other hand, it is not able to 
move its eyestalks to aim. Since all of its 
eyes were most likely facing forward at the 
moment of paralysis, the adventurers clev- 
erly spread out in a ring around the crea- 
ture. To attack one or two of them with its 
powers, the beholder must turn its back on 
the rest. 


104 


Energy Drain 


This is a feature of 
powerful undead (and other particularly 
nasty monsters). The energy drain is a par- 
ticularly horrible power, since it causes the 
loss of one or more experience levels! 

When a character is hit by an energy- 
draining creature, he suffers normal damage 
from the attack. In addition, the character 
loses one or more levels (and thus Hit Dice 
and hit points). For each level lost, roll the 
Hit Dice appropriate to the character's class 
and subtract that number of hit points from 
the character's total (subtract the Constitu- 
tion bonus also, if applicable). If the level(s) 
lost was one in which the character received 
a set number of hit points rather than a die 
roll, subtract the appropriate number of hit 
points. The adjusted hit point total is now 
the character's maximum (i.e., hit points 
lost by energy drain are not taken as dam- 
age but are lost permanently). 

The character's experience points drop to 
halfway between the minimum needed for 
his new (post-drain) level and the minimum 
needed for the next level above his new 
level. 

Multi-class and dual-class characters lose 
their highest level first. If both levels are 
equal, the one requiring the greater number 
of experience points is lost first. 

All powers and abilities gained by the 
player character by virtue of his former 
level are immediately lost, including spells. 
The character must instantly forget any 
spells that are in excess of those allowed for 
his new level. In addition, a wizard loses all 
understanding of spells in his spell books 
that are of higher level than he can now cast. 
Upon regaining his previous level, the spell- 
caster must make new rolls to see if he can 
relearn a spell, regardless of whether he 
knew it before. 

If a character is drained to Oth level but 
still retains hit points (i.e., he is still alive), 
that character's adventuring career is over. 
He cannot regain levels and has lost all ben- 
efits of a character class. The adventurer has 
become an ordinary person. A restoration 
or wish spell can be used to allow the char- 
acter to resume his adventuring career. If a 
Oth-level character suffers another energy 
drain, he is slain instantly, regardless of the 
number of hit points he has remaining. 

If the character is drained to less than 0 
levels (thereby slain by the undead), he re- 
turns as an undead of the same type as his 
slayer in 2d4 days. The newly risen undead 
has the same character class abilities it had 
in normal life, but with only half the experi- 
ence it had at the beginning of its encounter 
with the undead who slew it. 

The new undead is automatically an 
NPC! His goals and ambitions are utterly 
opposed to those he held before. He pos- 
sesses great hatred and contempt for his 


Combat (Character Death) 


former colleagues, weaklings who failed 
him in his time of need. Indeed, one of his 
main ambitions may be to destroy his 
former companions or cause them as much 
grief as possible. 

Furthermore, the newly undead NPC is 
under the total control of the undead who 
slew it. If this master is slain, its undead 
minions gain one level for each level they 
drain from victims until they reach the max- 
imum Hit Dice for their kind. Upon reach- 
ing full Hit Dice, these undead are able to 
acquire their own minions (by slaying char- 
acters). 

Appropriate actions on the part of the 
other player characters can prevent a drained 
comrade from becoming undead. The steps 
necessary vary with each type of undead and 
are explained in the monster descriptions in 
the Monstrous Compendium. 


Poison 


This is an all-too fre- 
quent hazard faced by player characters. 
Bites, stings, deadly potions, drugged 
wines, and bad food all await characters at 
the hands of malevolent wizards, evil assas- 
sins, hideous monsters, and incompetent 
innkeepers. Spiders, snakes, centipedes, 
scorpions, wyverns, and certain giant frogs 
all have poisons deadly to characters. Wise 
PCs quickly learn to respect and fear such 
creatures. 

The strength of different poisons varies 
wildly and is frequently overestimated. The 
bite of the greatly feared black widow spi- 
der kills a victim in the United States only 
once every other year. Only about 2% of all 
rattlesnake bites prove fatal. 

At the other extreme, there are natural 
poisons of intense lethality. Fortunately, 
such poisons tend to be exotic and rare—the 
golden arrow-poison frog, the western tai- 
pan snake, and the stonefish all produce 
highly deadly poisons. 

Furthermore, the effect of a poison de- 
pends on how it is delivered. Most fre- 
quently, it must be injected into the 
bloodstream by bite or sting. Other poisons 
are only effective if swallowed; assassins fa- 
vor these for doctoring food. By far the 
most deadly variety, however, is contact 
poison, which need only touch the skin to 
be effective. 

Paralytic poisons leave the character un- 
able to move for 2d6 hours. His body is 
limp, making it difficult for others to move 
him. The character suffers no other ill ef- 
fects from the poison, but his condition can 
lead to quite a few problems for his compan- 
ions, 

Debilitating poisons weaken the charac- 
ter for 1d3 days. All of the character's abil- 
ity scores are reduced by half during this 
time. All appropriate adjustments to attack 
rolls, damage, Armor Class, etc., from the 


lowered ability scores are applied during the 
course of the illness. Furthermore, the char- 
acter moves at one-half his normal move- 
ment rate. Finally, the character cannot heal 
by normal or magical means until the poi- 
son is neutralized or the duration of the de- 
bilitation is elapsed. 


Treating Poison Victims 

Fortunately, there are many ways a char- 
acter can be treated for poison. Several 
spells exist that either slow the onset time, 
enabling the character the chance to get fur- 
ther treatment, or negate the poison en- 
tirely. However, cure spells (including heal) 
do not negate the progress of a poison, and 
neutralize poison doesn’t recover hit points 
already lost to the effects of poison. In addi- 
tion, characters with herbalism proficiency 
can take steps to reduce the danger poison 
presents to player characters. 


Once a character is 
wounded, his player will naturally want to 
get him healed. Characters can heal either 
by natural or magical means. Natural heal- 
ing is slow, but it’s available to all charac- 
ters, regardless of class. Magical healing 
may or may not be available, depending on 
the presence (or absence) of spellcasters or 
magical devices. 

The only limit to the amount of damage a 
character can recover through healing is the 
total hit points the character has. A charac- 
ter cannot exceed this limit until he gains a 
new level, whereupon another Hit Die (or a 
set number of points) is added to his total. 
Healing can never restore more hit points to 
a character than his maximum hit point to- 
tal. 


Natural Healing 


Characters heal nat- 
urally at a rate of 1 hit point per day of rest. 
Rest is defined as low activity—nothing 
more strenuous than riding a horse or trav- 
eling from one place to another. Fighting, 
running in fear, lifting a heavy boulder, or 
any other physical activity, prevents rest- 
ing, since it strains old wounds and may 
even reopen them. 

If a character has complete bed rest (do- 
ing nothing for an entire day), he can regain 
3 hit points for the day. For each complete 
week of bed rest, the character can add any 
Constitution hit point bonus he might have 
to the base of 21 points (3 points per day) he 
regained during that week. 

In both cases above, the character is as- 
sumed to be getting adequate food, water, 
and sleep. If these are lacking, the character 
does not regain any hit points that day. 


105 


Magical Healing 


Healing spells, po- 
tions, and magical devices can s 
process of healing considerably. The spe- 
cifics of such magical healing methods are 
described in the spell descriptions in this 
book and in the DMG (for magical items). 
By using these methods, wounds close in- 
stantly and vigor is restored. The effects are 
immediate. 

Magical healing is particularly useful in 
the midst of combat or in preparation for a 
grievous encounter. Remember, however 
that the characters’ opponents are just as 
likely to have access to magical healing as 
the player characters—an evil high priest is 
likely to carry healing spells to bestow on 
his own followers and guards. Healing is 
not, of itself, a good or evil act. 

Remember that under no circumstances 
can a character be healed to a point greater 
than his original hit point total. For exam- 
ple, say a character has 30 hit points, but 
suffers 2 points of damage in a fight. A while 
later, he takes an additional point of dam- 
age, bringing his current hit point total to 
27. A spellcaster couldn't restore more than 
3 points to him, regardless of the healing 
method used. Any excess points are lost. 


Herbalism & Healing Proficiencles 


Characters can also 
gain minor healing benefits from those pro- 
ficient in the arts of herbalism and healing. 
These talents are explained in Chapter 5. 


Character Death 


When a character 
reaches 0 hit points, that character is slain. 
The character is immediately dead and un- 
able to do anything unless some specialized 
magical effect takes precedence. 


Death From Poison 


Poison complicates 
this situation, somewhat. A character who 
dies as a result of poisoning may still have 
active venom in his system. 

Poisons remain effective for 2d6 hours af- 
ter the death of the victim. If the character is 
raised during this time, some method must 
be found to neutralize the poison before the 
character is restored to life. If this is not 
done, then after the character rolls the res- 
urrection survival check as given in “Raising 
the Dead” on page 106 (and assuming the 
roll is successful), he must immediately roll 
a successful saving throw vs. poison or suf- 
fer all the effects of the poison in his body, as 
per the normal rules. This may only injure 
some characters, but it may kill other char- 
acters seconds after being raised! 


Combat (Character Death) 


Death From Massive Damage 


In addition to dy- 
ing when hit points reach 0, a character also 
runs the risk of dying abruptly when he suf- 
fers massive amounts of damage. A charac- 
ter who suffers 50 or more points of damage 
from a single attack must roll a successful 
saving throw vs. death, or he dies. 

This applies only if the damage was done 
by a single attack. Multiple attacks totaling 
50 points in a single round don’t require a 
saving throw. 

For example, a character would be required 
to make a check if a dragon breathed on him 
for 72 points of damage. He wouldn't have to 
do so if eight orcs hit him for a total of 53 
points of damage in that round. 

If the saving throw is successful, the char- 
acter remains alive (unless of course the 50- 
hit-point loss reduced his hit points to 0 or 
below!). If the saving throw fails, the char- 
acter immediately dies from the intense 


shock his body has taken. His hit points are 
reduced to 0, 

The character may still be raised in the 
normal ways, however. 


inescapable Death 


There are occasions 
when death is unavoidable, no matter how 
many hit points a character has. 

A character could be locked in a room 
with no exits, with a 50-ton ceiling descend- 
ing to crush him. He could be trapped in an 
escape-proof box filled completely with 
acid, These examples are extreme (and ex- 
tremely grisly), but they could happen in a 
fantasy world. 


Raising the Dead 


Curative and heal- 
ing spells have no effect on a dead 
character—he can only be returned to life 


with a raise dead or resurrection spell (or a 
device that accomplishes one of these ef- 
fects). Each time a character is returned to 
life, the player must make a resurrection 
survival roll based on his current Constitu- 
tion (see Table 3). If the die roll is successful 
(i.e., the player rolls equal to or less than his 
resurrection survival percentage), the char- 
acter is restored to life in whatever condi- 
tion is specified by the spell or device. 

A character restored to life in this way has 
his Constitution permanently lowered by 1 
point. This can affect hit points previously 
earned. Should the character's Constitution 
bonus go down, the character's hit point to- 
tal is reduced by the appropriate number of 
hit points (the amount of hit point bonus 
lost is multiplied by the number of levels for 
which the character gained extra hit points 
from that bonus). When the character's 
Constitution drops to 0, that character can 
no longer be raised. He is permanently re- 
moved from play.

Hidden out there in the campaign world are 
great treasures awaiting discovery. Ancient 
dragons rest on huge hordes of gold, silver, 
and gems. Orc chieftains greedily garner the 
loot from the latest raid. Mindless jellies 
ooze through the bones and armor of unfor- 
tunate souls. Foul lords of darkness cun- 
ningly leave small fortunes apparently 
unguarded, like spiders luring in the flies. 
Stooped wizards assemble shelves of arcane 
magical items. Some treasures, like those of 
dragons, are gathered and horded for rea- 
sons fully understood only by their collec- 
tors. Others are gathered for more mundane 
purposes—power, luxury, and security. A 
rare few troves date from eons before, their 
owners long dead and forgotten. Some trea- 
sure hordes are small, such as the pickings 
of a yellow mold. Others are enormous, 
such as the Tyrant King’s treasury. Trea- 
sures may be free for the taking or fiercely 
trapped and watched over. 


Treasure Types 


Treasure comes in 
many different forms and sizes, ranging 
from the mundane to the exotic. There are 
of course coins of copper, silver, gold, elec- 
trum, and platinum. But precious metals 
can also be shaped into gilded cups, etched 
bowls, or even silverware. Characters know 
the value of coins and will have no difficulty 
establishing their worth in most cases. How- 
ever, ancient treasure hordes may contain 
coins no longer used. It may be that these 
can be sold only by their weight. Objects 
made of valuable metal are even more diffi- 
cult to appraise. Either the characters must 
find a goldsmith who can value the item and 
a buyer willing to pay a fair price, or these 
too must be melted down for their metal. In 
large cities this is not too difficult. There are 
always appraisers and fences handy, 
although getting full value might be diffi- 
cult. (Accusations of theft are another small 
problem.) Characters must be aware of 
cheats and counterfeiters though. An appar- 
ently valuable bow! could actually be base 
metal plated in silver. The metal of coins 
could be debased with copper or brass. 
Weights could be rigged to give false prices. 
Characters must find merchants they can 
trust. 

Gems are another common form of trea- 
sure and here player characters are even 
more dependent on others. Unless the party 
has a skilled appraiser of precious stones, 
they're going to have to trust others. After 
all, those red stones they found in the last 
treasure could be cheap glass, richly colored 
but only marginally valuable quartz, semi- 
precious garnets, or valuable rubies. Again, 
the player characters are going to have to 
find a jeweler they can trust and be watchful 
for cheats and scams. However, truly tricky 
DMs might present your characters with 


uncut gems. These are almost impossible for 
the untrained eye to spot or appraise. Most 
characters (and most players) are not going 
to realize that a piece of unremarkable stone 
can be a valuable gem when properly cut. 

Perhaps the most difficult of all treasure 
items to appraise are objects of artistic val- 
ue. While gems cut or uncut are valuable, 
their worth can be greatly increased when 
used in a piece of jewelry. Gold is valuable 
by weight, but even more so when fash- 
ioned into a cup or pin. Dwarven craftsmen 
from hidden communities practice the finest 
arts of gem-cutting, while gnomish artisans 
in earthen burrows labor away on elaborate 
gold and silver filigrees. Ancient elven carv- 
ings, done in exquisitely grained woods, 
stand side by side with the purest of statues 
chiseled by man. All of these have a value 
that goes far beyond their mere materials. 

But artistic creations seldom have a fixed 
value. Their price depends on the player 
characters finding a buyer and that person's 
willingness to buy. A few large cities may 
have brokers in arts, merchants who know 
the right people and are willing to act as go- 
betweens. Most of the time, however, the 
player characters have to go to the effort of 
peddling their wares personally. This 
requires tact and delicacy, for such items are 
seldom bought by any but the wealthy and 
the wealthy often do not like stooping to 
business negotiations. Player characters 
must carefully avoid giving insult to the 
barons, dukes, counts, and princes they 
might deal with. 

Finally, there are the truly unusual things 
your character can find—furs, exotic ani- 
mals, spices, rare spell components, or even 
trade goods. As with art objects, the values 
of these items are highly subjective. First the 
player characters have to find a buyer. This 
is not too difficult for everyday things, such 
as furs or trade goods, but it can be a tre- 
mendous enterprise if you have a spell com- 
ponent that is useful only to the most 
powerful of wizards. Next the PCs must 
haggle about the price. Furriers and mer- 
chants do this as a matter of course. Others 
haggle because they hope the PCs do not 
know the true value of what they hold or 
because they themselves do not know. After 
all this, the PCs might be able to sell their 
goods. However, if you enter into this in the 
true spirit of role-playing and see it as part 
of the adventure, the whole process is 
enjoyable. 


Magical Items 


The treasures men- 
tioned thus far are all monetary. Their use- 
fulness is immediate and obvious. They give 
characters wealth, and with wealth comes 
power and influence. However, there are 
other treasures, very desirable ones, that 
your characters will not want to sell or give

Chapter 10: Treasure >, 


away. These are the magical items that your 
characters find and use. 

Although priests and wizards can make 
magical items (according to the guidelines 
your DM has for magical research), it is far 
more common for characters to find these 
items during the course of adventures. Mag- 
ical items are powerful aids for characters. 
With them, characters can gain bonuses in 
combat, cast spells with the mere utterance 
of a word, withstand the fiercest fire, and 
perform feats impossible by any other 
known means. Not all magical items are 
beneficial, however. Some are cursed, the 
result of faulty magical construction or, 
very rarely, the deliberate handiwork of 
some truly mad or evil wizard. 

A very few magical items are artifacts— 
items created by beings more powerful than 
the greatest player characters. These are 
perilously dangerous items to use. There are 
only three methods to determine how to use 
artifacts—dumb luck, trial and error, and 
diligent research. 

There are many different magical items 
your character can find, but they all fall into 
a few basic categories. Each type of magical 
item has properties you should be aware of. 

Magical Weapons: There can be a magi- 
cal version of nearly any type of normal 
weapon, although there are admittedly few 
magical bardiches or guisarme-voulges. By 
far the most common magical weapons are 
swords and daggers. A magical weapon typ- 
ically gives a +1 or greater bonus to attack 
rolls, increasing a character's chance to hit 
and cause damage. Perhaps magical swords 
are quicker on the attack, or maybe they're 
sharper than normal steel—the explanation 
can be whatever the DM desires. Whatever 
the reason, magical weapons give results far 
beyond those of even the finest-crafted non- 
magical blade. 

A rare few weapons have even greater 
powers. These may allow your character to 
sense danger, heal wounds, float in mid-air, 
or have the most amazing luck. The rarest 
of the rare can actually communicate with 
your character and are imbued with an 
other-worldly intelligence. While the most 
powerful of magical weapons, these clever 
instruments of destruction sometimes seek 
to impose their wills on their owners. 

When you find a magical weapon, more 
than likely you do not know its properties. 
Some functions, such as the advantage it 
gives you in combat, can be learned by trial 
and error. Other properties must be learned 
through research and spells. Ancient histo- 
ries and legend lore spells can provide infor- 
mation on the properties of your weapon. 
On rare occasions, properties are discov- 
ered through blind luck. Simply command- 
ing the weapon to activate one power after 
another (hoping it will suddenly spring to 
life) works only for the most minor 


abilities—detecting danger, spotting secret 


doors, or locating treasure. Greater abilities 
require that specific commands be uttered, 
perhaps in long-forgotten languages. 

Magical Armor: Enchanted armors are 
the complements to magical weapons. 
These armors have a +1 or better bonus to 
their normal Armor Class, being made of 
stuff stronger and finer than nonmagical 
armor. Furthermore, these armors grant 
some measure of protection against attacks 
that normal armors would not stop. Chain 
mail +1, for instance, improves the charac- 
ter’s saving throw against the fiery breath of 
a dragon by 1, thus providing more than 
just a physical shield. In rare instances, 
armor may possess extraordinary powers. 
Although such armors are generally finely 
made and elaborately engraved, characters 
can discover the armors’ powers only by the 
same methods they use to discover the 
powers of magical weapons. 

Potions and Oils: Magical potions and 
oils are easily found but hard to identify. 
They come in small bottles, jugs, pots, or 
vials and clearly radiate magic if a detection 
spell is used. However, the effect of any 
potion is unknown until some brave soul 
tries a small sample. The results can be quite 
varied. The imbiber may discover he can 
float or fly, resist great heat or cold, heal 
grievous wounds, or fearlessly face the 
greatest dangers. He may also find himself 
hopelessly smitten by the first creature he 


Treasure (Magical Items) 


sees or struck dead by a powerful poison. It 
is a risk that must be taken to learn the 
nature of the potion. 

Scrolls: Scrolls are a convenience and lux- 
ury for spellcasters. By reading the incanta- 
tion written on the pages, the priest or 
wizard can instantly cast that spell. He does 
not need to memorize it, have the material 
components handy, or do any of the things 
normal spellcasting requires. Experienced 
and powerful wizards normally spend their 
evenings preparing such scrolls for their 
own adventuring use. 

Some scrolls are usable by all characters, 
granting special but temporary protections 
from various dangers—evil creatures, were- 
wolves, powerful beings from other planes, 
etc. Other scrolls bear hideous or humorous 
curses, brought into effect at the mere read- 
ing of their titles. Unfortunately, the only 
way to know what a scroll contains is to 
silently scan its contents. For scrolls con- 
taining wizard spells, this requires the use of 
a read magic spell. Other scrolls can be read 
by all. This scan does not cast the spell writ- 
ten on the scroll, but it tells the character 
what is written there (and exposes him to 
the effects of curses). Once the scroll is read, 
it can be used at any time in the future by 
that character. 

Rings: Magical rings are usable by many 
different classes and bestow a wide range of 
powers, from pyrotechnic displays to wish- 


es. While the aura of a magical ring can be 
detected, its properties cannot be discov- 
ered until it is worn and the command word 
is uttered. (The command word is most 
commonly found inscribed on the inside of 
the band.) As with all magical items, some 
rings can harm your character. Worse still, 
cursed rings can be removed only with the 
aid of spells! 

Wands, Staves, and Rods: These are 
among the most powerful of standard magi- 
cal items. Wands are commonly used by 
wizards, allowing them to cast powerful 
spells with the flick of a wrist. Staves can be 
used by either a wizard or a priest. Staves 
can be truly destructive, dwarfing even the 
potential of a wand. Rods are the rarest of 
all, the accouterments of witch-kings and 
great lords. With rods come dominance and 
power. 

Fortunately for your character, few of 
these items are cursed or dangerous to han- 
dle. But all must be operated by a command 
word—a specific word or phrase that trig- 
gers the power within. No wand, stave, or 
rod shows any indication of its powers by 
mere sight or handling. Careful research 
and probing are most often needed to tap 
the potential stored within. 

Wands, staves, and rods are not limitless 
in their power. Each use drains them slight- 
ly, using up a charge. There is no power 
gauge or meter showing what is left. A char- 


Treasure (Dividing and Storing) 


acter discovers his wand is drained only 
when it no longer functions or suddenly 
crumbles into useless dust. 

Miscellaneous Magic: Miscellaneous 
magical items are where the true variety of 
magical treasures lies. Each item possesses 
some unique power. There are horseshoes to 
make your horse go faster, brooms to ride, 
sacks that hold more than they should, 
paints that create real things, girdles that 
grant great strength, caps to make your 
character smarter, books that increase abili- 
ty scores, and much, much more. Each item 
is different and not all can be identified in 
the same way. The effects of some become 
obvious the instant the item is handled, 
donned, or opened. Others require research 
and questioning to learn the command word 
needed to activate them. All are quite valu- 
able and rare. 

Artifacts and Relics: Finally, there are 
artifacts and relics. Don’t count on your PC 
ever finding one of these rarest of all magi- 
cal items. Even if your character does find 
one, think carefully before you decide to let 
him keep it permanently. Artifacts are the 
most powerful magical items in the game. 
Indeed, many are powerful enough to alter 
the course of history! They are all unique 
and have unique histories. You can never 
find more than one Hand of Vecna in a 
world, Because it is so unique, each artifact 
has special and significant powers. Artifacts 
never appear by accident; they are always 
placed by the DM. 

Finding artifacts is always the result of a 
very special adventure. Your DM has placed 
that artifact for a reason, It is not likely that 
he really intends for your characters to keep 
it. Instead, he has something arranged in 
which you need that artifact for a specific 
purpose. The problem with keeping arti- 
facts is that they are too powerful. Not only 
do they unbalance your character in the 
short run, they also eventually corrupt and 
destroy him. The magical power of artifacts 
is such that they destroy their owners soon- 
er or later. There is a price to be paid for 
power, and it is not a cheap one. 


Dividing and 
Storing Treasure 


Once your group 
completes a successful adventure, it is 
almost certain to have collected some trea- 
sure. Therefore, it helps to have some prear- 
ranged agreement about how this treasure is 
to be divided among the different player 
characters and their henchmen. This is a 
true role-playing decision that must be 
reached among all the players at the table. 
There are no rules about how your charac- 
ters should divide treasures. 

However, there are some suggested meth- 
ods and reasons to make or not make some 


agreements. If you bear these in mind, you 
will have fewer arguments and bad feelings 
between the different players and their char- 
acters in your group. 

Cash treasure is the easiest. The most 
direct and simplest method is equal shares 
for all player characters and full or half 
shares for all henchmen. A player may 
argue that his character's contribution was 
greater than that of other characters, but 
these things average out in the long run. 
Besides, that player has no real idea of the 
contribution of others. A character who 
guarded the rear may have discouraged hid- 
den opponents from springing an ambush 
on the group, something that only the DM 
knows. 

Additional considerations include ex- 
traordinary costs. Some adventuring 
groups establish a special fund to pay the 
costs (if there are any) of healing, resurrect- 
ing, or restoring fellow player characters. 
Again this works on the principle that all 
faced the danger and therefore all should 
share equally in the expenses. Other groups 
make allowances for differing character 
levels (higher level characters assumedly 
shouldered more of the burden of the 
adventure, and so should be rewarded pro- 
portionately.) Some parties give special 
rewards to those who took greater chances 
or saved others. These encourage everyone 
in the group to take part. 

Magical treasure is more difficult to 
divide up, since there is rarely enough to 
give a useful item to every character, nor are 
all items of equal value or power. Here you 
must rely more on your sense of fairness if 
you wish to maintain party harmony. Since 
magical items are worthwhile to a party 
only if they can be used, your first concern 
should normally be to get the right item into 
the right hands. A magical sword in the pos- 
session of a wizard is not nearly as useful as 
it would be in the hands of a fighter. Like- 
wise, a wand does a fighter little good but 
could be a potent addition to a wizard. 
Therefore it is a good idea to match items to 
characters. 

Alternatively, your party could deter- 
mine the price an item would sell for, and 
then make it available to any PC who is 
willing to give the rest of the party that 
amount of money. If more than one player is 
willing to pay the price, the interested play- 
ers could roll dice to see who gets the item. 
Or, for items that several characters could 
all use equally well (such as a potion of heal- 
ing that is useful to all), the characters can 
bargain with each other and roll dice for 
choices. A player character may relinquish 
a claim on one magical item in exchange for 
another. A character who has already 
received a magical item may not be allowed 
another choice if there are not enough pieces 
to go around. If no other agreement can be 
reached, the players can roll dice and have 


their characters pick in descending order. It 
is a fair method (since people cannot right- 
fully complain about a random roll), but it 
can create imbalances. One or two charac- 
ters could wind up with the bulk of the mag- 
ical items over the course of several 
adventures. At this point, they would be 
wise to voluntarily withdraw from the selec- 
tion process. 

There are tactical issues to think about 
when distributing treasure. It is simply not 
wise for one or two characters to carry the 
bulk of the party's magical items. Successful 
adventurers spread their gear throughout 
their party. (This holds true even for explor- 
ers and special forces in the real world.) This 
way, if one character falls off the cliff and 
disappears forever or is spirited away by an 
invisible stalker, the party has not lost ev- 
erything. To illustrate another consider- 
ation, you are better off to have the fighters, 
thieves, and mages carry the healing potions 
rather than let the cleric do it, since he has 
healing spells. If he has both the healing 
spells and the potions and should disappear 
into the mist, your party has lost all its heal- 
ing ability. If it is spread around through the 
group, at worst you might lose the potions 
or the spells, but not both (unless disaster 
really strikes, in which case there is no way 
to prevent it anyway). In the end, you will 
find that it does not pay to be too greedy. 

Once your characters have assembled a 
sizeable amount of treasure, they have to 
find some place to keep it. If your DM is 
running a fairly medieval campaign, one 
thing PCs are not going to find is a bank like 
today’s. Instead, your characters must find 
other ways to keep their money secure. 
Chests with strong locks are a good start, 
but there are still better methods. One 
choice is to make the treasure small enough 
that you can carry it with you at all times. 
(Of course, one good mugging and you're 
broke.) There is also the difficulty of buying 
a drink with a 1,000-gp gem. A second 
choice is to place your money in the hands 
of someone you think you can trust. We all 
know what the risks are there. You could 
have your character give his fortune to a 
local lord or church and then hope to call in 
favors at a future date. This is not quite as 
foolish as it sounds. If the beneficiary of 
your largess refuses to honor your agree- 
ment, you'll never give him money again 
and neither will anyone else, most likely. If 
no one gives him any money, where will he 
find the funds to support his life-style? No, 
such a person must seriously try to honor 
his commitments. Of course, he may not do 
as much as you would like. The best solu- 
tion is that used throughout history—buy 
goods and chattels. Land, livestock, and 
trade goods are harder to steal and harder to 
lose. If you must keep a large fortune, it is 
best to keep it in something that can be car- 
ried easily and is unlikely to be stolen. 


Chapter 11: Encounters 


Whenever a player character meets an NPC 
(non-player character), fights a monster, or 
even discovers a mysterious fountain in the 
woods, he is having an encounter. An 
encounter is any significant thing a charac- 
ter meets, sees, or interacts with during the 
course of a game, When a player character 
discovers the fountain of blue flame in the 
midst of the forest, its very strangeness 
forces the character to react and the player 
to think. Why is it here? Does it have a pur- 
pose? Is it beneficial or dangerous? Few 
characters are going to pass this by as just 
another flaming fountain in the forest. 

Encounters are vital to the AD&D® game, 
for without them nothing can really happen 
to the player character. An adventure with- 
out encounters is like sitting in a room all 
day with no one to talk to and little to look 
at. It certainly wouldn't be very exciting. 
And who wants to play an unexciting role- 
playing game? Encounters provide danger, 
risk, mystery, information, intrigue, sus- 
pense, humor, and more. 

For an encounter to provide excitement, it 
must also have an element of danger. A 
good deal of this comes from the fact that 
player characters don’t know how the 
encountered beings will react to them, Your 
DM is not going to say, “You meet a group of 
peasants and they are friendly.’ (If he does 
say this, you ought to be suspicious.) 
Instead, he will say something like, “As you 
ride around the bend, you come upon an ox- 
cart lumbering down the road. A young 
man in rough clothes is leading the cart. 
Peering over the sides are a woman and sev- 
eral dirty children. When the man sees you 
he nods, smiles, and says, ‘Hail, strangers. 
Have you news of Thornhampton-on-the- 
Hill?’ ” You can probably guess they are 
peasants and they seem friendly, but your 
DM didn't come out and said so. Not know- 
ing for sure is what keeps you on your toes. 
They could be anything! 

When your character travels or explores a 
dungeon, your DM will have prepared two 
general types of encounters. The first are 
specific (planned) encounters. These are 
meetings, events, or things the DM has cho- 
sen to place in the adventure to build on the 
story of the adventure. 

For example, upon sneaking into the bug- 
bear stronghold, your characters find a 
squalid cell filled with humans and elves. 
Your DM has placed them here for your 
character to rescue. Of course, he could also 
be playing a trick and the prisoners could 
actually be evil dopplegangers (creatures 
able to change their appearances at will). 

Later, while in the hallway, your group 
bumps into a bugbear patrol. This is the sec- 
ond type of encounter, a random encounter, 
also called a wandering encounter. In this 
case, your DM has made die rolls to see if 
you come upon something and, if so, just 
what that something is. 


Specific encounters generally have more 
choices of action—your DM may want you 
to discover some important information or 
set up a particularly difficult battle. Specific 
encounters usually yield greater treasures 
and more magical items. Creatures may be 
placed by the DM to guard the armory or 
prevent the characters from reaching the 
throne room. 

Random encounters normally involve 
simple choices—run away, fight, or ignore. 
Sometimes characters can talk to creatures 
in random encounters and learn valuable 
information, but not often. Random 
encounters also tend to have little or no 
treasure. A patrol of city guardsmen does 
not carry as many valuable items on its 
rounds as it would have in its barracks. 
Random encounters are most often used to 
weaken PCs, raise an unexpected alarm, 
hurry them along, or just make their lives 
difficult. 

Sometimes encounters are not with peo- 
ple or monsters but with things. The foun- 
tain in the forest is an encounter, but your 
characters cannot fight it or talk to it (well, 
maybe not). So what are you supposed to 
do? In these cases, the encounter is more of a 
puzzle. You have to figure out why this 
fountain is here, what it can do, and if it is 
important to your adventure. It may be a 
red herring—something placed there just to 
confuse you; it may be a set up for a future 
adventure—later on your characters may 
learn that the flaming fountain they saw is 
important to their latest mission. It may bea 
deadly trap. To find out, though, you will 
have to deal with the thing in some way. You 
could throw stones into the pool, drink the 
glowing water, try to walk through the 
flames, or use spells to learn more. By doing 
these things, you may get more information 
from your DM. Of course, you may not like 
the answer! (“You drank the water? Oh, 
dear. Tsk, tsk, tsk.”) 


The Surprise Roll 


Sometimes an en- 
counter, either random or planned by the 
DM, catches one of the two groups involved 
totally off guard. This is called surprise and 
is determined by rolling 1d10 for each side 
(or only one side if the DM has decided that 
one of the sides cannot be surprised, for 
some reason). If the die roll is a 1, 2, or 3, 
that group or character is surprised (for 
effects, see the “Effects of Surprise” section). 
Naturally, surprise does not happen all the 
time. There are many easy and intelligent 
ways it can be prevented. The most obvious 
is if the player characters can see those they 
are about to encounter well before getting 
close. For example the characters may see 
the dust of a group of horsemen coming 
their way, or notice the lanterns of a group 
of peasants coming through the woods, or 


hear the grunting barks of a gnoll war party 
closing through the trees. In these cases 
there is no way the characters are going to 
be surprised by the encounter. But if a leop- 
ard leaped upon one of the group while he 
was intently watching the approaching 
riders, or if a group of goblins suddenly 
sprang from the darkness, then the charac- 
ters would have to roll to see if they were 
surprised. They were unprepared for these 
threats and so could be taken off guard. 

The DM decides when a check for sur- 
prise must be made. He can require that one 
roll be made for the entire party, that a sepa- 
rate check be made for each character, or 
that only specific characters check. This 
depends entirely upon the situation. 

For example, the entire party is intently 
watching the band of approaching riders. 
Then a leopard leaps from the branches of a 
tree overhead. The DM knows that no one 
in the group was particularly paying atten- 
tion to the treetops, so he has one person in 
the group roll the surprise die for the entire 
party. The roll is a 2, the PCs are surprised, 
the leopard gets a free round of attacks, and 
there is mass confusion as the clawing, bit- 
ing creature lands in their midst! If two of 
the characters had been on a general watch, 
the DM could have had these characters roll 
for surprise instead of the entire group. If 
both were surprised, the entire group would 
have been unprepared for the leopard’s 
attack. Otherwise, one or both of the 
guards might have noticed the creature 
before it pounced. Experienced player char- 
acters quickly learn the value of having 
someone on watch at all times. 

The surprise roll can also be modified by 
Dexterity, race, class, cleverness, and situa- 
tion. The DM has the listing of modifiers 
that apply to given situations. Modifiers can 
affect either your character's chance of 
being surprised or his chance of surprising 
others. A plus to your die roll reduces the 
odds that you are surprised; a minus 
increases those odds. Likewise, a minus to 
the enemy’s die roll means that the modifier 
is in your favor, while a plus means that 
things are going his way. High Dexterity 
characters are virtually unsurpriseable, 
caught off guard only in unusual situations. 

It is important to bear in mind that sur- 
prise and ambush are two different things. 
Surprise works as explained above. An 
ambush is prepared by one group to make 
an unexpected attack on another group and 
works only if the DM decides the other 
group cannot detect the ambush. A proper- 
ly set ambush gives the attackers the oppor- 
tunity to use spells and normal attacks 
before the other side reacts. If the ambush 
succeeds, the ambushing group gets its ini- 
tial attack and the other group must roll for 
surprise in the next round, so the ambushing 
group may get two rounds of attacks before 
the other group can reply. 


Encounters (Distance) 


Effects of Surprise 


Characters and mon- 
sters that are surprised all suffer the same 
penalty. They are caught off guard and thus 
cannot react quickly. The surprising group 
receives one round of attacks with melee, 
missile, or magical items. They cannot use 
these moments of surprise to cast spells. 

A ranger on the unsurprised side could 
fire his long bow twice (two attacks per 
round) before his opponents could even 
hope to react. A fighter able to attack twice 
per round could attempt both hits before 
any initiative dice are rolled. A mage could 
unleash a bolt from his wand of lightning 
before the enemy knew he was there. Of 
course, what applies to player characters 
also applies to monsters, so that the leopard 
in the earlier example could claw and bite 
before the characters even knew what was 
happening. 

The second effect of surprise is that the 
surprised characters lose all AC bonuses for 
high Dexterity during that instant of sur- 
prise. The surprised characters are dumb- 
founded by the attack. Instead of ducking 
and countering, they're just standing there 
rather flat-footed (maybe even with dumb 
expressions on their faces). Since they don’t 
grasp the situation, they cannot avoid the 
hazards and dangers very well. 

Surprise can also be used to avoid an 
encounter. Unsurprised characters can 
attempt to flee from a surprised group 
before the other group reacts. Of course, 
this is not always successful, since escape is 
greatly dependent upon the movement rates 
of the different creatures. 

If both groups manage to surprise each 
other, the effects of surprise are cancelled. 
For example, Rath runs around the corner 
straight into some lounging guardsmen. 
Taken by surprise, he stops suddenly and 
frantically looks for someplace else to run. 
The guardsmen in turn look up rather stu- 
pidly, trying to figure out why this dwarf 
just raced around the corner. The surprise 
passes. Rath spots another alley and the 
guards decide that since he's running, Rath 
must be a criminal. Initiative rolls are now 
made to see who acts first. 


Encounter Distance 


Once your charac- 
ter or party has an encounter and it has been 
determined whether or not anyone was sur- 
prised, your DM will tell you the range of 
the encounter—the distance separating you 
from the other group. Many factors affect 
encounter distance. These include the open- 
ness of the terrain, the weather conditions, 
whether surprise occurred, and the time of 
day, to name a few. Although you do not 
know the exact distance until your DM tells 
you, surprise, darkness, or close terrain 


(woods, city streets, or narrow dungeons) 
usually results in shorter encounter dis- 
tances, while open ground (deserts, plains, 
or moors), good light, or advance warning 
results in greater encounter distances (see 
Chapter 13). 


Encounter Options 


Once an encounter 
occurs, there is no set sequence for what 
happens next. It all depends on just what 
your characters have encountered and what 
they choose to do. That's the excitement of a 
role-playing game—once you meet some- 
thing, almost anything could happen. There 
are some fairly common results of encoun- 
ters, however. 

Evasion: Sometimes all you want is for 
your characters to avoid, escape, or other- 
wise get away from whatever it is you've 
met, Usually this is because you realize your 
group is seriously outmatched. Perhaps 
returning badly hurt from an adventure, 
your group spots a red dragon soaring over- 
head. You know it can turn your party to 
toast if it wants. Rather than take that risk, 
your group hides, waiting for it to pass. Or, 
topping a ridge, you see the army of 
Frazznargth the Impious, a noted warlord. 
There are 5,000 of them and six of you. 
Retreat seems like the better part of valor, so 
you turn your horses and ride. 

Sometimes you want to avoid an encoun- 
ter simply because it will take too much 
time. While riding with an urgent message 
for his lord, your character rides into a 
group of wandering pilgrims. Paying them 
no mind, he lashes his horse and gallops 
past. 

Evading or avoiding an encounter is not 
always successful. Some monsters pursue, 
others do not. In the examples above, 
Frazznargth the Impious (being a prudent 
commander) orders a mounted patrol to 
chase the characters and bring them in for 
questioning. The pilgrims, on the other 
hand, shout a few oaths as your galloping 
horse splashes mud on them and then con- 
tinue on their way. Your character's success 
at evading capture will depend on move- 
ment rates, determination of pursuit, ter- 
rain, and just a little luck. Sometimes when 
he really should be caught, your character 
gets lucky. At other times, well, he just has 
to stand his ground. 

Talk: Your character doesn’t run from 
encounters all the time, and attacking ev- 
erything you meet eventually leads to prob- 
lems. Sometimes the best thing to do is talk, 
whether it’s casual conversation, hardball 
negotiation, jovial rumor-swapping, or 
intimidating threats. In fact, talking is often 
better than fighting. To solve the problems 
your DM has created for your character, 
you need information. Asking the right 
questions, developing contacts, and putting 


112 


out the word are all useful ways to use an 
encounter. Not everything you meet, 
human or otherwise, is out to kill your char- 
acter. Help often appears in the most sur- 
prising forms. Thus it often pays to take the 
time to talk to creatures. 

Fight: Of course, there are times when 
you don’t want to or can’t run away. (Run- 
ning all the time is not that heroic.) And 
there are times when you know talking is 
not a good idea. Sooner or later, your char- 
acter will have to fight. The real trick is 
knowing when to fight and when to talk or 
run. If you attack every creature you meet, 
the first thing that will happen is that 
nobody will want to meet with your charac- 
ter. Your character will also manage to kill 
or chase off everyone who might want to 
help him. Finally, sooner or later your DM 
is going to get tired of this and send an 
incredibly powerful group of monsters after 
your character. Given the fact that you've 
been killing everything in sight, he’s justified 
in doing this. 

So it is important always to know who 
you are attacking and why. As with the best 
police in the world today, the trick is to fig- 
ure out who are the bad guys and who are 
the good guys. Make mistakes and you pay. 
You may kill an NPC who has a vital clue, 
or unintentionally anger a baron far more 
powerful than yourself. NPCs will be reluc- 
tant to associate with your character, and 
the law will find fewer and fewer reasons to 
protect him. It is always best to look on 
combat as a last resort. 

Wait: Sometimes when you encounter 
another group, you don’t know what you 
should do. You don’t want to attack them in 
case they are friendly, but you don’t want to 
say anything to provoke them. What you 
can do is wait and see how they react. Wait- 
ing is a perfectly sensible option. However, 
there is the risk that in waiting, you lose the 
advantage should the other side suddenly 
decide to attack. Waiting for a reaction so 
that you can decide what to do causes a +1 
penalty to the first initiative roll for your 
group, if the other side attacks. 


Of course, in any given encounter, there 
may be many other options open to your 
character. The only limit is your imag- 
ination (and common sense). Charging a 
band of orcs to break through their lines and 
flee may work. Talking them down with an 
elaborate bluff about the army coming up 
behind you might scare them off. Clever use 
of spells could end the encounter in sudden 
and unexpected ways. The point is, this is a 
role-playing game and the options are as 
varied as you wish to make them.

Player characters cannot fight, survive, 
wheel, deal, plot, or scheme without inter- 
acting with non-player characters (NPCs). 
Indeed, the very heart of the AD&D® game 
is the relationship between player charac- 
ters and non-player characters. How the 
player characters react to and treat NPCs 
determines the type of game the group 
plays. Although many choices are possible, 
players quickly find that consideration and 
good treatment of NPCs is the most fre- 
quently successful route. 

An NPC is any person, creature, or mon- 
ster that is controlled by the DM. Most 
NPCs are either people (intelligent races 
that live in local society) or monsters (intel- 
ligent and unintelligent creatures that aren't 
normally found in towns and villages). The 
term “monster” is only a convenient label. It 
doesn’t mean the creature is automatically 
dangerous or hostile. Likewise, NPCs who 
are people aren’t uniformly helpful and 
cooperative. As with all things, the range of 
possible reactions of NPCs to PCs covers 
the entire spectrum. 

In the course of their adventures, player 
characters will be most concerned with 
three groups of NPCs: hirelings, followers, 
and henchmen. It is their aid that helps play- 
er characters vanquish deadly monsters and 
accomplish mighty deeds. As their names 
imply, these NPCs can be persuaded in vari- 
ous ways to join the player characters in 
their adventures. The most common meth- 
ods of persuasion are money and loyalty. 


Hirelings 


The most frequent- 
ly employed NPC is the hireling. A hireling 
is a person who works for money. Most 
hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while 
others are masters of a craft or art, anda 
few are experts of specialized adventuring 
skills. Typical hirelings include the follow- 
ing: 


Archer Architect 
Armorer Assassin 
Baker Blacksmith 
Bladesmith Foot Soldier 
Jeweler Laborer 
Messenger Minstrel 
Sage Sailor 

Spy Thief 


Hirelings are always employed for a 
stated term of service or for the perform- 
ance of a specific task. Thus a mercenary 
contracts to serve for a season. A thief can 
be hired to steal a named item. A sage works 
to answer a single question. A blacksmith 
may indenture himself for a term of years. A 
sailor works for a single voyage. Quite 
often these contracts can be renewed with- 
out difficulty, but the only thing that binds a 
hireling to the player character is regular 
pay and good treatment. Hirelings do not 


serve a PC out of any great loyalty. 

Thus there are some things hirelings will 
not do. Most hirelings do not foolishly risk 
their lives. There are soldiers willing to take 
their chances on the field of battle, but even 
these courageous (or foolish) few do not 
willingly undertake the greater hazards of 
adventuring. They man castle walls, guard 
caravans, collect taxes, and charge the 
massed foe well enough, but they often 
refuse to accompany a PC on an adventure. 
Even a hireling who regularly undertakes 
dangerous missions (a thief or an assassin, 
for example) normally refuses to join player 
character parties. These hirelings are loners. 
They contract to do a job and get it done in 
their own way, without interference from 
anyone else. 

Hirelings are no more loyal than human 
nature allows. For the most part, if paid and 
treated well, with opportunities to realize 
their ambitions, working for a charismatic 
leader, hirelings can be relied on to do their 


jobs faithfully. But poor pay, injustice, dis- 
crimination, threats, abuse, and humilia- 
tion at the hands of their masters make them 
somewhat less than reliable. A smart leader 
sees to the comfort and morale of his men 
before his own concerns. With less savory 
characters—those hired to perform dark 
deeds—the player character takes even 
greater chances, especially given the ques- 
tionable morals of such characters. 

Whatever their personalities, hirelings 
generally need to make morale checks 
(explained in the DMG) whenever they are 
faced with a particularly dangerous situa- 
tion or are offered a bribe or other tempta- 
tion. 

Finding hirelings is not difficult. People 
need jobs. It is simply a matter of advertis- 
ing. Under normal circumstances, appli- 
cants respond to ads. Only when trying to 
employ vast numbers or hire those with 
unusual specialties (such as spies) does the 
process become complicated. Just what 


needs to be done in this situation depends 
entirely upon the DM's campaign. Your 
character may have to skulk through the 
unsavory bars of the waterfront, rely on 
questionable go-betweens, or pay a visit to 
the thieves’ guild (if there is one). Just 
employing one of these characters can be a 
small adventure in itself. 

Employment costs of hirelings vary from 
a few gold pieces a month to thousands of 
gold pieces for an especially dangerous task. 
The skill and experience of a hireling has a 
great effect on his salary. A learned sage 
researching some obscure piece of lore can 
charge hefty sums. Costs can also be affect- 
ed by the conditions of the campaign—the 
setting, the recent events of the world, and 
the reputations of the player characters (if 
any). Most hirelings sign on for what they 
think is fair. While few will turn down more 
money, most will drive the best bargain they 
can. Your DM has more information about 
employment costs, since he may need to 
alter these to fit his campaign. 


Followers 


More reliable than 
those who are motivated purely by money 
are those characters who, while they expect 
pay, were originally drawn into service by 
the reputation of the player character. These 
are followers, usually a unit of soldiers of 
one type or another. Followers serve only 
those of significant power and reputation, 
thus the construction of a stronghold is nec- 
essary to attract followers. 

Followers have the same needs and limita- 
tions of hirelings. Most must be paid and 
well-treated. They also do not accompany 
the player characters on group adventures. 
They have some advantages over hirelings, 
however. Followers do not serve for a spe- 
cific term of contract. They remain with the 
player character as long as their basic needs 
are met. They are more loyal than the aver- 
age hireling and are treated as elite troops. 
Unlike most hirelings, followers can 
increase in level (although this occurs very 
slowly since they act only as soldiers). All 
followers in a unit advance to the next level 
at the same time. Finally, the player charac- 
ter need not seek out followers—they come 
to him, seeking positions within his illustri- 
ous household. 

Followers appear only once. Replace- 
ments do not arrive to fill the ranks of the 
fallen. (Massive losses of followers in com- 
bat only gives the character a bad reputa- 
tion, discouraging others from flocking to 
his banner.) Player characters should take 
care of their followers, perhaps treating 
them as an elite bodyguard. 

Some characters attract unique followers 
such as animals or magical beings. 
Although termed followers, these creatures 
are more properly treated as henchmen in 


terms of loyalty and what they will and will 
not do. They do not count against the char- 
acter’s limit on henchmen, however, since 
they are technically followers. 


Henchmen 


Henchmen are much 
that hirelings are not. They are adventurers 
who serve out of loyalty. They are willing to 
risk their lives for those they respect. They 
are also hard to find. 

Henchmen are powerful allies to a player 
character. Unlike hirelings, they have the 
nerve and ability to become powerful 
adventurers. Although they expect their 
share of treasure, they do not usually join a 
player character for money. They are 
attracted to the PC because of his reputation 
or other qualities he possesses. As such, 
henchmen cannot be expected to flock to the 
banner of a neophyte adventurer. He may 
gain himself one or two companions, but 
others come only when he has earned a 
greater reputation, met more people, and 
proven himself a true friend and ally to 
these NPCs. 

Henchmen can come from any source. 
Most often they are at first mere hirelings or 
followers who, through distinctive actions, 
come to the attention of the player charac- 
ter. Some may be higher level, more skilled 
hirelings who develop a bond to the player 
character through long employment. Oth- 
ers may be followers who have sound 
advice for the player character. 

A henchman is always of lower level than 
the PC. Should he ever equal or surpass the 
PC's level, the henchman leaves forever; it is 
time for him to try his luck in the real world. 
In some ways, the player character is the 
mentor and the henchman his student. 
When the student has learned as much as the 
teacher, it is time for him to go out on his 
own. 

Henchmen are more than just loyal fol- 
lowers; they are friends and allies. Natu- 
rally they expect to be treated as such. They 
have little need for those who do not trust 
them or treat them coldly. Abusiveness or 
taking advantage of the friendship quickly 
ends the relationship. Just as players must 
with their own friends, player characters 
must be sensitive to the needs and feelings of 
their henchmen, Furthermore, henchmen 
attach themselves to a particular player 
character, not a group of player characters. 
Thus it is only under the direst of circum- 
stances that a henchman accepts the orders 
of another PC. Should his friend (the player 
character) fall, the henchman sees to his 
needs. He doesn’t abandon him and con- 
tinue on with the other player characters 
unless this is clearly the only way to aid his 
friend. 

A PC's Charisma determines the maxi- 
mum number of henchmen he can have. 


115 


NPCs (Followers) 


This is a lifetime limit, not just a maximum 
possible at any given time. In a world where 
the fallen can be restored to life, it is expect- 
ed that a man would make this effort for his 
dearest friends, both player characters and 
henchmen. For example, Rupert the half-elf 
has had seven henchmen, but all have fallen 
for one reason or another. Rupert's Cha- 
risma is 15, so with the death of his latest 
henchman, no more come to join him. 
(Word has obviously gotten around that 
Rupert's friends tend to meet unpleasant 
ends, and he doesn’t even have the decency 
to bring them back to life! Even if he had 
tried to raise his henchmen and failed, 
Rupert would still be viewed as a jinx, bad 
luck for those around him.) 

Attracting a henchman is fairly difficult. 
One cannot advertise for friends with any 
great success. They grow and develop from 
other relationships. A henchman can be 
found by placing trust in a skilled hireling. 
Heroic deeds (saving the life of an NPC) can 
create a strong and instant bond. Love cer- 
tainly can form this bond. The player and 
the DM must trust their own judgment to 
determine when an NPC becomes a hench- 
man. There is no clear line an NPC must 
cross to make the transition from hireling to 
henchman. Instead, it is a slide from one sta- 
tus to the other. 

Once an NPC becomes a henchman, the 
player gains a high degree of control over 
the character. He should be responsible for 
the record keeping for that character. It is 
almost, but not quite, like having a new PC 
for the player. If the DM allows it, the play- 
er can have all information regarding the 
abilities of the henchman, although the DM 
may choose not to reveal this information. 
The player is allowed to make nearly all 
decisions for the NPC, but the DM can 
overrule any action as being out of charac- 
ter. 

There are certain things henchmen do not 
do. They do not give away or loan out mag- 
ical items. They do not allow others free 
access to their spell books. They do not tol- 
erate spell use that questions their loyalty 
(detect lie or know alignment cast upon 
them). They do not accept less than their 
due share. In general, within these limits, 
henchman do what is desired of them. The 
DM can at any time dictate the actions of a 
henchman, since the character is still an 
NPC. 

If a PC is not attentive to the wishes and 
needs of his henchmen, or if he abuses and 
humiliates them, he can expect the worst. 
This is the stuff mutinies and rebellions are 
made of. Should an abusive player charac- 
ter fall at the hands of a once-loyal hench- 
man, he has only himself to blame. 

On the other hand, not all henchmen are 
paragons of loyalty. The player character 
must always be aware that henchmen are 
sometimes not what they seem. They can be 


a means to get at the player character. 
Throughout history, many a cruel and cun- 
ning villain has posed as a true companion, 
waiting his chance to strike or spy on his 
friend. 


Player Character 
Obligations 


Whenever a player 
character takes on a hireling, follower, or 
henchman, he has committed himself to cer- 
tain obligations and customs that surround 
such agreements. Some of these are obvi- 
ous, having been worked out between the 
player character and the NPC in advance. 
Usually the wage and term of service are set- 
tled upon before any agreement is reached. 
For hirelings and followers, this is a set 
amount of money each day, week, or 
month, or a fee for a specific task. Hench- 
men commonly receive a portion (1/2 a nor- 
mal share) of all treasure and magic found 
on adventures. A player character is nor- 
mally expected to contribute a little more 
from his own funds, however. 

Other obligations of the player character 
are varied. Some must always be consid- 
ered, while others almost never come into 
effect. A player character is expected to pro- 
vide meals and boarding (unless the NPC 
has a home nearby), This is the most com- 
mon obligation and applies to NPCs of all 
walks of life. For those engaged in more 
dangerous pursuits, however, additional 
concessions must be granted. Since horses 
are expensive, player characters should be 
ready to cover the cost of mounts lost in 
combat or on campaign. It is unreasonable 
to expect a mercenary to buy a new mount 
from his meager savings. Likewise, other 
items of war craft—weapons and armor— 
must be replaced by the player character. 
All soldiers are expected to provide their 
own equipment when they are first 
employed, but the player character must 
replace all losses. Certainly all player char- 
acters are expected to pay the cost of special 
transport—securing passage on ships and 
arranging wagons for baggage. Of the grim- 
mer duties, player characters are expected 
to pay for a decent (though hardly lavish) 
interment. 

One of the more unusual obligations of a 
player character is to ransom his men. This 
is especially true of men lost during a cam- 
paign. The greater number of soldiers lost in 
a battle are not slain but captured. Common 
practice of the medieval period was to offi- 
cially ransom these prisoners for well- 
established prices. A common yeoman 
footman might ransom for 2 gp, a minor 
priest for 80 gp, a knight's squire for 200 gp, 
and a king's man for 500 gp. These are paid 
for by the lord of the prisoner. A player 
character (as a lord and master) is expected 


NPCs (Player Character Obligations) 


to do the same. Of course, the player char- 
acter can pass much of this cost on to his 
own subjects and the relatives of the pris- 
oner. Thus men might languish for long per- 
iods in the hands of the enemy before their 
ransom was raised. Furthermore, should a 
player character ransom a hireling, fol- 
lower, or henchman, he has every reason to 
expect loyal service from that man in the 
future. After all, he has demonstrated his 
willingness to save that NPC from hardship 
and death. 

In a fantasy world, a player character is 
also expected to bear the cost of magical 
spells cast to the benefit of his men. He may 
arrange to have his men blessed before bat- 
tle or healed after it. He shouldn't grumble 
about the expense, because the spells also 
make good tactical sense. The bless spell 


a 


PSE

increases the success of his army in the field. 
Magical cures get his army back on its feet 
quicker. All these things can make him very 
successful while also making him popular 
with his hired men. 

Finally, the player character is expected to 
make an effort to raise or restore slain 
henchmen. This is not a normal expectation 
of hirelings or followers (although it can 
happen in extreme cases). The effort should 
be honest and true. A player character 
shouldn't fool himself into thinking no one 
will notice if he doesn’t do his utmost. The 
player character who returns from an 
adventure minus his henchman is automati- 
cally under a cloud of suspicion, despite his 
most vehement protests. A player character 
must take great care to maintain his reputa- 
tion as a good and upright employer. 


Chapter 13: Vision and Light 


Before a character can do anything in the 
dungeon or the wilderness, he has to be able 
to see what he is doing. If a character can't 
see a target, his chances of hitting it are very 
small. If he can’t see, he can’t read a scroll or 
a large “Keep Out” sign on the wall. In the 
AD&D® game, characters can see set dis- 
tances and often by fantastic means that 


defy logic. 


Limits of Vision 


The first limitation 
on vision is how far away an object can be 
before it cannot been seen clearly. Size and 
weather have a great effect on this. Moun- 
tains can be seen from great distances, 60 to 
100 miles or more, yet virtually no detail 
can be seen. On level ground, the horizon is 
about five to 12 miles away, but a character 
usually cannot see a specific object that far 
away. The limit of vision for seeing and 
identifying man-sized objects is much less 
than this. 

Under optimum conditions, the maxi- 
mum range at which a man-sized object can 
be seen is about 1,500 yards, if it is moving. 
If the object doesn’t move, it usually cannot

be seen at this distance. Even if it is moving, 
all that can be seen is a moving object. The 
character cannot tell what it is or what it is 
doing. 

At 1,000 yards, both moving and station- 
ary man-sized objects can be spotted. Gen- 
eral size and shape can be determined, but 
exact identifications are impossible. It is not 
likely that creature type can be identified at 
this range, unless the creature has a very 
unique shape. 

At 500 yards, general identifications can 
be made. Size, shape, color, and creature 
type are all distinguishable. Individuals still 
cannot be identified, unless they are distinc- 
tively dressed or separated from the rest of 


117 


the group. Livery and heraldic symbols or 
banners can seen if large and bold. Most 
coats of arms cannot be distinguished at this 
distance. General actions can be ascertained 
with confidence. 

At 100 yards, individuals can be identi- 
fied (unless, of course, their features are 
concealed), Coats of arms are clear. Most 
actions are easily seen, although small 
events are unclear. 

At 10 yards, all details but the smallest 
are clear. Emotions and actions are easily 
seen, including such small actions as pick- 
pocketing (if it is detectable). 

Of course, conditions are seldom perfect. 
There are a number of factors that can 
reduce visibility and alter the ranges at 
which things can be spotted and identified. 
Table 62 lists the effects of different types of 
conditions. 

All ranges are given in yards. 

“Movement” indicates the maximum dis- 
tance at which a moving figure can be seen. 
“Spotted” is the maximum distance a mov- 
ing or a stationary figure can be seen. 
“Type” gives the maximum distance at 
which the general details of a figure can be 
seen—species or race, weapons, etc. “ID” 
range enables exact (or reasonably exact) 
identification. “Detail” range means small 
actions can be seen clearly. 

There are many factors other than weath- 
er that affect viewing. Size is an important 
factor. When looking at a small creature 
(size S), all categories are reduced to the 
next lower category (except the “detail” 
range, which remains unchanged). Thus, 
under clear conditions, the ranges for seeing 
a small creature are “movement” at 1,000 
yards, “spotted” at 500 yards, “type” at 100 
yards, and “ID” and “detail” at 10 yards. 

When sighting large creatures, the “move- 
ment,” “spotting,” and “type” ranges are 
doubled. Exceptionally large creatures can 
be seen from even greater distances. Large 
groups of moving creatures can be seen at 
great distances. Thus it is easy to see a herd 
of buffalo or an army on the march. 

The ranges given in Table 62 do not take 
terrain into account. All ranges are based on 
flat, open ground. Hills, mountains, tall 
grass, and dense woods all drastically 
reduce the chances of seeing a creature. (The 
terrain does not alter sighting ranges, only 
the chances of seeing a creature.) Thus, even 


Vision and Light (Light) 


though on a clear day woods may hide a 
bear until he is 30 yards away, it is still a 
clear day for visibility. The bear, once seen, 
can be quickly and easily identified as a 
bear. The DM has more information on spe- 
cific terrain effects on sighting. 

As a final caveat, the ranges in Table 62 
assume Earth-like conditions. Sighting con- 
ditions on one of the Lower Planes, or the 
horizon distance on another world, could be 
entirely different. If your DM feels he must 
take this into account, he will have to learn 
more about the subject at his local library or 
make it up. 


Light 


Most characters can- 
not see much without light. Some night con- 
ditions (those for the outdoors) are given in 
Table 62. But all of these assume some small 
amount of light. In totally lightless condi- 
tions, normal vision is impossible, unless a 
source of light is carried by the party. 

Light sources vary in the area they affect. 
Table 63 gives the radius of light and burn- 
ing time for the most common types of light 
sources. 


Table 63: LIGHT SOURCES 


Source Radius Burning time 
Beacon lantern 240 ft.* 30 minutes/pint 
Bonfire 50 ft. 1/2 hour/armload 
Bullseye lantern 60ft.* 2 hours/pint 
Campfire 35 ft 1 hour/armload 
Candle 5 ft 10 minutes/inch 
Continual light 60 ft. Indefinite 
Hooded lantern 30 ft. 2 hours/pint 
Light spell 20 ft. Variable 

Torch 15 ft. 30 minutes 
Weapon** 5 ft. As desired 


* Light from these is not cast in a radius, 
but a rather in a cone-shaped beam. At its 
far end, the cone of light from a beacon lan- 
tern is 90 feet wide. A bullseye lantern has a 
beam 20 feet wide at its far end. 

** Magical weapons shed light if your 
DM allows this optional rule. 


Of course, while a lantern or fire enables 
characters to see, it does have some disad- 
vantages. The greatest of these is that it is 
hard to sneak up on someone if he can see 
you coming. It is hard to remain inconspicu- 
ous when you have the only campfire on the 
plain, or you are carrying the only torch in 
the dungeon. Furthermore, not only do 
creatures know you are coming, they can 
generally see you before you see them (since 
the light source illuminates the area around 
you, those outside this area can see into the 
area). Characters should always bear these 
risks in mind. 


Infravision 


Some characters 
and monsters have the power of infravision. 
This can mean one of two things, i 
on whether the standard or the optional rule 
is used (this is discussed in detail in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide). The choice is left 
to the DM and he must tell the players how 
he wants infravision to work. Regardless of 
how the power functions, the range of infra- 
vision is at most 60 feet unless otherwise 
noted. 


118 


At times it is useful 
for characters to look at objects or creatures 
via reflections in a mirror. This is particular- 
ly true of those creatures so hideous (such as 
a medusa) that gazing directly upon them 
might turn the viewer to stone. When using 
a mirror, a light source must be present. Sec- 
ond, attempting to direct your actions by 
looking in a mirror is very disorienting (try 
it and see). Thus, all actions requiring an 
ability or proficiency check or an attack roll 
suffer a —2 penalty. The character also loses 
all Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class if 
fighting an opponent seen only in a mirror. 


Chapter 14: Time and Movement 


As in the real world, time passes in all 
AD&D® game worlds. Weeks slip away as 
wizards research spells. Days go by as char- 
acters ride across country. Hours pass while 
exploring ruins. Minutes flash by during 
battles. All of these are passages of time. 

There are two different types of time that 
are talked about in these rules. Game time is 
the imaginary time that passes for the char- 
acters in the game. Real time is the time in 
the real world, the time that passes for the 
players and DM as they play the AD&D 
game. The two times are very different; 
players and DMs should be careful to distin- 
guish game time from real time. 


For example, when the character 
Delsenora researches a spell for three weeks, 
this is three weeks of game time. Delsenora 
is out of action as three weeks passes in the 
campaign world. Since nothing interesting 
at all happens to Delsenora during this 
research time, it should require only a min- 
ute or two of real time to handle the situa- 
tion. The exchange in real time is something 
like this: 


Louise (Delsenora’s player): “Delsenora's 
going to research her new spell.” 

DM: “Okay, it'll take three weeks. Nothing 
happens to her. While she's doing that, 
the rest of you get a chance to heal your 
wounds and do some stuff that you've 
been ignoring. Johann [pointing at 
another player], you'd better spend some 
time at the church. The patriarch's been a 
little upset that you haven't been attend- 
ing ceremonies.” 

Jon (Johann’s player): “Can't I go out and 
earn some more experience?” 

DM (Not wanting to deal with a split-up 
group): “The patriarch mumbles some- 
thing about failing in your duties to your 
deity, and he rubs his holy symbol a lot. 
You know, it's not very often that low 
levels like you have personal audiences 
with the patriarch. What do you think?” 

Jon: “Marvelous. Subtle hint. I'll stay and 
be a good boy.” 

DM: “Well, great! The three weeks pass. 
Nothing happens. Del, make your roll 
for the spell research.” 


And so three weeks of game time flash by 
in brief minutes of real time. 

The importance of game time is that as a 
campaign progresses, characters tend to 
become involved in different time- 
consuming projects. Three characters may 
set off on a four-week overland journey, 
while a mage researches for six weeks. At 
the inn, a fighter rests and heals his wounds 
for two weeks. It is important to note how 
much time passes on different tasks, so the 
activities of different characters can be fol- 
lowed. 

Campaign time is measured just as it is in 


real life: years, months, weeks, days, hours, 
minutes, and seconds. But, since this is a 
fantasy game, the DM can create entirely 
different calendars for his world. There may 
be only ten months in the year or 63 days to 
a month. When beginning play, these things 
are not tremendously important, so players 
need not worry about them right away. 
With continued adventuring, players even- 
tually become familiar with the calendar of 
the campaign. 

Rounds and turns are units of time that 
are often used in the AD&D game, particu- 
larly for spells and combat. A round is 
approximately equal to a minute (it is not 
exactly one minute, so as to grant the DM 
some flexibility during combat). A turn is 
equal to ten minutes of game time. Turns are 
normally used to measure specific tasks 
(such as searching) and certain spells. Thus 
a spell that lasts ten turns is equal to 100 
minutes or 12/3 hours. 


Movement 


Closely related to 
time is movement. Clearly your character is 
able to move, otherwise adventures would 
be rather static and boring. But how fast can 
he move? If a large, green carrion crawler is 
scuttling after Rath, is the redoubtable 
dwarf fast enough to escape? Could Rath 
outrun an irritated but heavily loaded elf? 
Sooner or later these considerations become 
important to player characters. 

All characters have movement rates that 
are based on their race. Table 64 lists the 
movement rates for unencumbered charac- 


ters of different races. 


Table 64: BASE MOVEMENT RATES 


Race Rate 
Human 12 
Dwarf 6 
Elf 12 
Half-elf 12 
Gnome 6 
Halfling 6 


A character can normally walk his move- 
ment rate in tens of yards in a single round. 
An unencumbered human can walk 120 
yards (360 feet), slightly more than a foot- 
ball field, in one minute. A dwarf, similarly 
equipped, can walk 60 yards in the same 
time. This walk is at a fairly brisk, though 
not strenuous, pace that can be kept up for 
long periods of time. 

However, a character may have to move 
slower than this pace. If the character is car- 
rying equipment, he may move slower 
because of the encumbrance (see page 76), if 
this optional rule is used. As the character 
carries more gear, he gradually slows down 
until he reaches the point where he can bare- 
ly move at all. 

When a character is moving through a 
dungeon or similar setting, his movement 
rate corresponds to tens of feet per round 
(rather than the tens of yards per round of 
outside movement). It is assumed that the 
character is moving more cautiously, pay- 
ing attention to what he sees and hears while 
avoiding traps and pitfalls. Again, this rate 
can be lowered if the optional encumbrance 
system is used. 


119 


Time and Movement (Jogging and Running) 


Characters can also move faster than the 
normal walking pace. In the dungeon (or 
anytime the character is using his dungeon 
movement rate) the character can automati- 
cally increase his movement to that of his 
normal walking pace. In doing so, however, 
he suffers a —1 penalty to his chance of 
being surprised and gives a +1 bonus to 
others on their chance of being surprised by 
him (the rapidly moving character is not 
taking care to conceal the noise of his pas- 
sage in the echoing confines of the under- 
ground). Furthermore the character does 
not notice traps, secret doors, or other unu- 
sual features. 

It is also certainly possible for a character 
to jog or run—an especially useful thing 
when being chased by creatures tougher 
than he cares to meet. The simplest method 
for handling these cases is to roll an initia- 
tive die. If the fleeing character wins, he 
increases the distance between himself and 
his pursuers by 10 times the difference in the 
two dice (in feet or yards, whichever the 
DM feels is most appropriate). This is 
repeated each turn until the character 
escapes or is captured. (If this seems unreal- 
istic, remember that fear and adrenaline can 
do amazing things!) 


(Optional Rule) 
If your DM 


wants greater precision in a chase, the 
speeds of those involved in the chase can 
be calculated exactly, (But this is time- 


consuming 

ing chase.) Using this optional rule, a 
character can always double his normal . 
movement rate (in yards) to a jog. Thus a 
character a movement rate of 12 
can jog 240 yards in a round. While jog- 


been reached, the player must roll a suc- 
cessful Constitution check at the end of 
each additional round spent jogging. 
There are no modifiers to this check. 
Once a Constitution check is failed, the 
character must stop and rest for as many 
rounds as he spent jogging. After this, he 


can resume his pace with no pen- 
alties (abo nee fbokalinneon 
duration apply). 


If a jogging pace isn’t fast enough, a 
character can also run. If he rolls a suc- 
cessful Strength check, he can move at 
three times his normal rate; if he rolls a 


ghack:mneie ndly Gukte char 


acter cannot increase his speed to the 
level he was trying to reach, but he can 
keep running at the pace he was at before 
the failed Strength check. Once a charac- 
ter fails a Strength check to reach a level 
of running, he cannot try to reach that 
level again in the same run. 

Continued running requires a Consti- 
tution check every round, with penalties 
that depend on how long and how fast 
the character has been running. There is 
a —1 penalty for each round of running 
at triple speed, a —2 penalty for each 
round of running at quadruple speed, 
pessghh iris Nae yf Segundo 
ning at quintuple speed penalties 
are cumulative). If the check is passed, 
the character can continue at that speed 
for the next round. If the check is failed, 
the character has exhausted himself and 
must stop running. The character must 
rest for at least one turn. 


For example, Ragnar the thief has a 
Strength of 14, a Constitution of 15, and 
a movement rate of 12. Being pursued by 
the city guard, he starts jogging at 240 
yards a round. Unfortunately, so do 

they. His Constitution is a 14, so he can 
keep going for at least 14 rounds. He 
decides to speed up. The player rolls a 
Strength check, rolling a7. Ragnar pours 
on the speed, increasing up to 360 yards 
per round (triple speed). Some of the 
drop out of the race, but a 
few hold in there. Ragnar now has a —1 
penalty to his Constitution check. A 13 is 
rolled, so he just barely passes. 

But one of the blasted guardsmen is 
still on his tail! In desperation, Ragnar 
tries to go faster (trying for four times 
walking speed). The Strength check is an 
18: Ragnar just doesn't have any more 
oomph in him; he can't run any faster, 
but he is still running three times faster 
than his walking speed. The player now 
must roll a Constitution check with a —2 
penalty (for two rounds of running at tri- 
ple speed). The player rolls the die and 
gets a4—no problem! And just then the 
last drops out of the race. 
Ragnar takes no chances and keeps run- 
ning. Next round another Constitution 
check is necessary, with a —3 penalty. 
The player rolls an 18. Exhausted, 


Ragnar collapses in a shadowy alley, tak- 
ing care to get out of sight. 
Cross-Country Movement 
A normal day's 


marching lasts for ten hours, including rea- 
sonable stops for rest and meals. Under nor- 
mal conditions, a character can walk twice 
his movement rate in miles in those ten 
hours. Thus an unencumbered man can 


120 


walk 24 miles across clear terrain. 

Characters can also force march, inten- 
tionally hurrying along, at the risk of 
exhaustion. Force marching enables a char- 
acter to travel 2 1/2 times his movement rate 
in miles (thus a normal man could force 
march 30 miles in a day). At the end of each 
day of the march, the character or creature 
must roll a Constitution check. Large par- 
ties (such as army units) make the check at 
the average Constitution of the group 
(weaker members are supported, encour- 
aged, and goaded by their peers). Creatures 
must roll a saving throw vs. death at the end 
of each day’s force marching (since they lack 
Constitution scores). A —1 penalty is 
applied to the check for each consecutive 
day spent force marching. If the check is 
passed, the force marching pace can be con- 
tinued the next day. If the check fails, no 
more force marching attempts can be made 
until the characters have completely recov- 
ered from the ordeal. Recovery requires 1/2 
day per day of force marching. 

Even if the Constitution check fails, the 
character can continue overland movement 
at his normal rate. 

One drawback of force marching is that 
each day of force marching results in a —1 
penalty to all attack rolls. This modifier is 
cumulative. Half a day's rest is required to 
remove one day's worth of force marching 
penalty. Characters who have managed to 
force march for eight straight days suffer a —8 
penalty to their attack rolls; it takes four days 
of rest to return to no attack roll penalty. 

Overland movement rates can be 
increased or decreased by many factors. 
Terrain can speed or slow movement. Well- 
tended roads allow faster marching, while 
trackless mountains slow marches to a 
snail's pace. Lack of food, water, and sleep 
weaken characters. Poor weather slows 
their pace. All these factors are detailed in 
the DMG. 


Swimming 


All characters are 
either untrained swimmers or proficient 
swimmers. 

When the DM determines the swimming 
ability of characters, the decision should be 
based on his campaign. If the campaign is 
centered around a large body of water, or if 
a character grew up near the sea, chances 
are good that the character knows how to 
swim. However, being a sailor does not 
guarantee that a character can swim. Many 
a medieval mariner or black-hearted pirate 
never learned how to swim and so devel- 
oped a morbid fear of the water! This is one 
of the things that made “walking the plank” 
such a fearful punishment. Furthermore, 
some character races are normally suspi- 
cious of water and swimming. While these 
may vary from campaign to campaign, 


dwarves and halflings often don’t know 
how to swim. 

Untrained swimmers are a fairly hapless 
lot. When they are unencumbered, they can 
manage a rough dog-paddle in relatively 
calm waters. If the waters are rough, the 
current strong, or the depth excessive (at sea 
or far out on a lake), untrained swimmers 
may panic and sink. If weighed down with 
enough gear to reduce their movement rate, 
they sink like stones, unable to keep their 
heads above water. In no way do they make 
any noticeable progress (unless, of course, 
the object is to sink beneath the surface). 

Proficient swimmers are able to swim, 
dive, and surface with varying degrees of 
success. All proficient characters are able to 
swim 1/2 their current land movement rate 
times 10 in yards, provided they are not 
wearing metal armor. A character with a 
movement rate of 12 could swim 60 yards 
(180 feet) in a round. Characters whose 
movement rates have been reduced to 1/3 or 
less of normal (due to gear) or who are 
wearing metal armor cannot swim—the 
weight of the gear pulls the character under. 
They can still walk on the bottom, however, 
at 1/3 their current movement rate. 

Proficient swimmers can double their 
swimming speed, if a successful Strength 
check is rolled (vs. 1/2 the character's normal 
Strength score). For a character with a 
movement rate of 12, a successful check 
means he can swim 120 yards in one round, 
an Olympic-class performance. 

Like running, swimming is not something 
that a character can do indefinitely. There 
are several different speeds a character can 
choose to swim at, thus moving in either 
short sprints or a slower, but longer-lasting, 
pace. 

* If swimming at 1/2 normal speed or 
treading water, the character can maintain 
this for a number of hours equal to his Con- 
stitution score (although he will have to 
abandon most of his gear). After a character 


swims for a number of hours equal to his 
Constitution, a Constitution check must be 
made for each additional hour. For each 
extra hour of swimming, 1 Constitution 
point is temporarily lost (regaining lost abil- 
ity points is explained in the next column). 

Each hour spent swimming causes a 
cumulative penalty of —1 to all attack rolls. 

All this assumes calm water. If the seas 
are choppy, a Constitution check should be 
made every hour spent swimming, regard- 
less of the character's Constitution. Rough 
seas can require more frequent checks; 
heavy seas or storms may require a check 
every round. The DM may decide that 
adverse conditions cause a character's Con- 
stitution score to drop more rapidly than 1 
point per hour. 

If a swimming character fails a Constitu- 
tion check, he must tread water for 1/2 hour 
before he can continue swimming (this 
counts as time spent swimming, for pur- 
poses of Constitution point loss). 

A character drowns if his Constitution 
score drops to 0. 


As an example, a freak wave sweeps Fiera 
(an elf) overboard during the night. Fortu- 
nately she can swim.and knows that land is 
nearby. Bravely, she sets out through calm 
water. Her Constitution score is 16. After 14 
hours of steady swimming, she makes out 
an island on the horizon. Two hours later 
she is closer, but still has some way to go. 
During the next hour (her 17th in the water), 
her Constitution drops to 15 (her attack 
penalty is — 17!) and she must make a Con- 
stitution check, A 12 is rolled—she passes. 
In the last hour, the 18th, the seas become 
rough. Her Constitution is now 13 (the DM 
ruled that the heavy seas made her lose 2 
points of Constitution this hour), and the 
DM decides she must pass an extra Consti- 
tution check to reach shore. She rolls a5 and 
flops onto shore, exhausted. 


121 


* Characters can also swim long distances 
at a faster pace, although at increasing risk. 
Swimming at the character's normal move- 
ment rate (instead of the usual swimming 
speed of ?/2 the normal movement rate) 
requires a Constitution check every hour, 
reduces Strength and Constitution by 1 
point every hour, and results ina —2 cumu- 
lative attack penalty for each hour of swim- 
ming. Characters can swim at twice this 
speed (quadruple normal swimming speed), 
but they must roll a check every turn and 
suffer the above penalties for every turn 
spent swimming. Again, when an ability 
score reaches 0, the character sinks and 
drowns, 

* Upon reaching shore, characters can 
recover lost ability score points and negate 
attack penalties by resting. Each day of rest 
recovers 1d6 ability points (if both Strength 
and Constitution points were lost, roll 1d3 
for each ability to determine points recov- 
ered) and removes 2d6 points of attack pen- 
alties. Rest assumes adequate food and 
water. Characters need not be fully rested 
before undertaking any activity, although 
the adjusted ability scores are treated as the 
character's current scores until the character 
has rested enough to fully recover from the 
swim. 


To continue the earlier example with Fiera, 
after a bad last hour in the water, she reaches 
shore. Her Constitution is 13 and she has a 
— 18 penalty to her attack roll. Exhausted, she 
finds some ripe fruit and collapses in the shade 
of a palm tree, All the next day she rests. At 
the end of the day she rolls a 4 on 1d6 and 
regains 4 points of Constitution, restoring it to 
normal. An 8 is rolled to reduce her attack 
penalty, so the next day she suffers only a — 10 
penalty to her attack roll. The next day of rest 
lowers this by 6 to —4 and the third day erases 
it completely. So in three days she has fully 
recovered from her 18-hour ordeal in the 
water. 


Time and Movement (Climbing) 


Holding Your Breath 


Under normal cir- 
cumstances (with a good gulp of air and not 
performing strenuous feats), a character can 
hold his breath up to '/3 his Constitution 
score in rounds (rounded up). If the charac- 
ter is exerting himself, this time is halved 
(again rounded up). Characters reduced to 
Ys or less of their normal movement be- 
cause of encumbrance are always consid- 
ered to be exerting themselves. If unable to 
get a good gulp of air, these times are re- 
duced by */2. All characters are able to hold 
their breath for one round, regardless of cir- 
cumstances. 

While attempting to hold his breath be- 
yond this time, the character must roll a 
Constitution check each round. The first 
check has no modifiers, but each subsequent 
check suffers a —2 cumulative penalty. 
Once a check is failed, the character must 
breathe (if he cannot reach the surface, he 
drowns). 

Diving: All characters can dive to a depth 
of 20 feet in a single round. For each encum- 
brance category above unencumbered (or 
for each point of movement below the char- 
acter’s normal rate, if this optional system is 
used—see page 76), two feet is added to this 
depth (the additional weight helps pull the 
character down). A short run or a few feet 
of height adds 10 feet of depth to the first 
round of a dive. For every 10 feet of height 
above the water, an additional five feet of 
depth is added, up to a maximum addition 
of 20 feet. Thus, with a run and from a 
height of 40 feet or more, an unencumbered 
man can dive 50 feet in a single round. 

Surfacing: A character can normally rise 
at the rate of 20 feet per round. This rate is 
reduced by two feet for every encumbrance 
category above unencumbered or for every 
point of current movement below the char- 
acter's normal rate (if this optional system is 
used). Note that, under the optional encum- 
brance system, heavily loaded characters 
(those who have lost 10 or more points off 
their normal movement rate because of their 
current encumbrance) cannot even swim to 
the surface. Those simply floating to the 
surface (unconscious characters, for exam- 
ple) rise at a rate that is five feet per round 
slower than someone similarly encumbered 
who is actively swimming up to the surface. 


It is quite possible for a moderately 
weighed-down character to sink if he makes 
no effort to stay on the surface. 


Climbing 


Although thieves 
have specialized climbing abilities, all char- 
acters are able to climb to some degree or 
another. Climbing ability is divided into 
three categories: thief, mountaineer, and 
unskilled, 

Thieves are the most skilled at climbing. 
They are the only characters who can climb 
very smooth, smooth, and rough surfaces 
without the use of ropes or other equip- 
ment. They are the fastest of all climbers 
and have the least chance of falling. 

Mountaineers are characters with moun- 
taineering proficiency or those the DM 
deems to possess this skill. They have a bet- 
ter climbing percentage than unskilled char- 
acters. Mountaineers with proper equip- 
ment can climb very smooth, smooth, and 
rough surfaces. They can assist unskilled 
characters in all types of climbs. 

Unskilled climbers are the vast majority 
of characters. While they are able to scram- 
ble over rocks, they cannot use climbing 
equipment or negotiate very smooth, 
smooth, and rough surfaces. They have the 
lowest climbing success rate of all charac- 
ters. 


Calculating Success 


The chance of suc- 
cess of a climb is calculated by taking the 
character's skill level (given as a percentage) 
and modifying it for his race, the condition 
of the surface, and situational modifiers. Ta- 
ble 65 lists the percentages for the different 
categories of climbers. 

The chance of success given in Table 65 is 
modified by many factors. Some of these re- 
main the same from climb to climb (such as 
a character's race) and can be figured into 
the character's base score. Others depend on 
the conditions of a given climb. All of these 
are listed on Table 66. 


Table 66: CLIMBING MODIFIERS 


Situation Modifier 
Abundant handholds 

(brush, trees, ledges) +40% 
Rope and wall ** +55% 
Sloped inward +25 % 
Armor 

Banded, splint -25% 

Plate armors (all types) —50% 

Scale, chain -15% 

Studded leather, padded -5%

Dwarf -10% 

Gnome —15% 

Halfling -15% 
Encumbrance —-5%/t 
Surface condition: 

Slightly slippery 

(wet or crumbling) —25% 

Slippery (icy, slimy) — 40% 
Climber wounded below '/2hp —-10% 


* These are the same as the modifiers 
given in Table 27. Make sure that thief char- 
acters are not penalized twice for race. 

°* Rope and wall applies in most climbing 
situations in which the character is able to 
brace his feet against the surface being 
climbed and use a rope to assist in the task. 

} This is -5% per encumbrance category 
above unencumbered, or per movement 
rate point lost off normal movement rate. 


The final result of Tables 65 and 66 is the 
number the character uses for Climbing 
checks. A Climbing check is made by rolling 
percentile dice. If the number rolled is equal 
to or less than the number found from Ta- 
bles 65 and 66, the character succeeds with 
the Climbing check. Rolls above this num- 
ber indicate failure. 

A Climbing check must be made any time 
a character tries to climb a height of 10 feet 
or more. This check is made before the char- 
acter ascends the first 10 feet of the climb. If 
the check is passed, the character can con- 
tinue climbing. If the check is failed, the 
character is unable to find a route and can- 
not even attempt the climb. No further at- 
tempts can be made by that character until a 
change occurs. This is either a significant 
change in location (a half mile or more 
along the face of a cliff) or an improvement 
in the character's chance of success. 


For example, Brondvrouw the gnome is 
an unskilled climber. Her normal chance of 


success is 25% (40% — 15% for being a 


Table 66¢ BASE CLIMBING SUCCESS RATES gnome). She has been cut off from the rest of

rope, Brondvrouw can again try the climb, 
since her percentage chance is now 80%. A 
27 is rolled and she makes the ascent. 


* Only if optional proficiency system is used. 


122 


On particularly long climbs—those 
greater than 100 feet or requiring more than 
one turn (10 minutes) of climbing time—the 
DM may require additional checks. The fre- 
quency of these checks is for the DM to 
decide. Characters who fail a check could 
fall a very long way, so it is wise to carry 
ropes and tools. 


Climbing Rates 

Climbing is differ- 
ent from walking or any other type of 
movement a character can do. The rate at 
which a character moves varies greatly with 
the different types of walls and surfaces that 
must be climbed. Refer to Table 67. Crossre- 
ference the type of surface to be climbed 
with the surface condition. Multiply the 
appropriate number from the table by the 
character's current movement rate. The 
result is the rate of climb for the character, 
in feet per round, in any direction (up, 
down,.or sideways). 

All the movement rates given on Table 67 
are for non-thief characters. Thief charac- 
ters are able to climb at double the move- 
ment rate for normal characters. 


Ragnar the thief and his companion 
Rupert (a half-elf) are climbing a cliff with 
rough ledges. A recent rain has left the sur- 
face slightly slippery. Ragnar has a move- 
ment rate of 12 and Rupert's is 8. Ragnar can 
cover 12 feet per round (12 X 1 since he isa 
thief), but Rupert struggles along at the pace 
of 4 feet per round (8 X 1/2). If Ragnar had 
gone up first and lowered a rope to Rupert, 
the half-elf could have climbed at the rate of 
8 feet per round using rope and wall (8 X 1).

* Non-thief characters must be mountaineers and have appropriate tools (pitons, rope, 


etc.) to climb these surfaces. 


** Thief characters can climb very smooth, slightly slippery surfaces at 1/4. 
Even thieves cannot climb very smooth, slippery surfaces. 


Types of Surfaces 


Very smooth sur- 
faces include expanses of smooth, uncrack- 
ed rock, flush-fitted wooden walls, and 
welded or bolted metal walls. Completely 
smooth walls, unbroken by any feature, 
cannot be climbed by anyone without tools. 

Smooth and cracked walls include most 
types of well-built masonry, cavern walls, 
maintained castle walls, and slightly eroded 
cliff faces. 

Rough faces are most natural cliffs, poor- 
ly maintained or badly built masonry, and 
typical wooden walls or stockades. Any 
natural stone surface is a rough face. 

Rough with ledges is similar to rough 
faces but is dotted with grips three inches or 
more wide. Frost-eroded cliffs and natural 
chimneys are in this category, as are mason- 
ry buildings falling into ruin. 

Ice walls are cliffs or faces made entirely 
of frozen ice. These are different from very 
smooth and smooth surfaces in that there 
are still many natural cracks and protru- 
sions. They are extremely dangerous to 
climb, so a Climbing check should be made 
every round for any character attempting it 
without tools. 


Trees includes climbs with an open frame- 
work, such as a scaffold, as well as trees. 

Sloping walls means not quite cliff-like 
but too steep to walk up. If a character falls 
while climbing a sloping wall, he suffers 
damage only if he fails a saving throw vs. 
petrification. If the save is made, the charac- 
ter slides a short distance but is not harmed. 

Rope and wall require that the character 
uses a rope and is able to brace himself 
against a solid surface. 


Actions While Climbing 


Although it is pos- 
sible to perform other actions while climb- 
ing, such as spellcasting or fighting, it is not 
easy. Spellcasters can use spells only if they 
are in a steady, braced position, perhaps 
with the aid of other characters. 

Climbing characters lose all Armor Class 
bonuses for Dexterity and shield and most 
often have rear attack modifiers applied 
against them also. Their own attack, dam- 
age, and saving throw rolls suffer —2 penal- 
ties. Those attacking from above gain a +2 
bonus to their attack rolls, while those 
attacking from below suffer an additional 
—2 penalty to their attack rolls. A climbing 


Time and Movement (Climbing) 


character cannot use a two-handed weapon 
while climbing. The DM can overrule these 
penalties if he feels the player character has 
reached a place of secure footing. If struck 
while climbing (for any amount of damage), 
the character must make an immediate 
Climbing check. Failure for a roped charac- 
ter means he spends a round regaining his 
balance; an unroped character falls if he 
fails this check. 


Climbing Tools 


Tools are an inte- 
gral part of any mountaineer’s equipment 
and all climbs can profit from the use of 
tools. Mountaineering tools include rope, 
pitons (spikes), and ice axes. However, it is 
a mistaken belief that the main function of 
tools is to aid in a climb. The main purpose 
of pitons, rope, and the like is to prevent a 
disastrous fall. Climbers must rely on their 
own skills and abilities, not ropes and 
spikes, when making a climb. Accidents 
happen when people forget this basic rule 
and trust their weight to their ropes and 
pitons. 

Therefore, aside from ropes, other tools 
do not increase the chance of climbing suc- 
cess. However, in the case of a fall, climbing 
tools can reduce the distance fallen. When a 
character falls, he can fall only as far as the 
rope allows, if being belayed, or as far as 
twice the distance to the last piton set (if the 
piton holds—a piton pulls free 15% of the 
time when a sudden stress occurs). The dis- 
tance fallen depends on how far apart the 
pitons have been set. Falling characters fall 
twice the distance to the last spike that 
holds. 


For example, Rath is 15 feet above his last 
piton. Suddenly he slips. He falls the 15 feet 
to his piton, plus another 15 feet past his 
piton since there's 15 feet of rope between 
him and the piton, for a total of 30 feet 
fallen and 3d6 points of falling damage. 


Roping characters together increases indi- 
vidual safety, but it also increases the chance 
that more than one person falls. When a 
character falls, the character(s) on either 
side of the falling climber must roll Climb- 
ing checks (a penalty of —10 is applied for 
each falling character after the first one to 
fall). If all checks are successful, the fall is 
stopped and no one suffers any damage. If a 
check is failed, that character also falls and 
Climbing checks must be repeated as before. 
Climbing checks are made until either the 
fall is stopped (the climbers on either side of 
the falling character[s] successfully roll 
Climbing checks or the last nonfalling 
climber succeeds with his check), or all the 
roped-together characters fall. 


For example, a party of five is roped 
together as they go up the cliff. Suddenly 
Johann falls. Megarran, immediately above 
him, and Drelb, following him, must roll 
Climbing checks. Megarran passes her 
check. But Drelb fails and is snapped off the 
wall. Now Megarran must make another 
check with a —10 penalty (for two falling 
characters), and Targash, who's bringing up 
the rear, must also roll a check with a -10 
penalty. Both succeed on their rolls and the 
fall is stopped. 


Getting Down 


Aside from jump- 
ing or flying, the quickest way to get down 
from a height is to rappel. This requires a 
rope attached at the top of the climb and a 


skilled mountaineer to set up the rappel and 
to hold the rope at the bottom. When rap- 
peling down a surface, a Climbing check 
with a +50 bonus must be rolled. Free rap- 
pels (the end of the rope unsupported at the 
bottom) can also be done, but the modifier 
is only +30. Of course, a failed check 
results in a slip sometime during the rappel 
(the DM decides on the damage suffered). A 
character can rappel at a speed equal to his 
normal dungeon movement (120 feet/round 
for an unencumbered human). One other 
thing to bear in mind is that there must be a 
landing point at the end of the rope. Rap- 
pelling 60 feet down a 100-foot cliff means 
the character is either stranded at the end of 
the rope or, worse still, rappels right off the 
end and covers the last 40 feet much faster 
than he did the first 60!

Appendix 2: Notes on Spells 


Spell Descriptions 


The spells are orga- 
nized according to their group (Priest or 
Wizard) and level, starting on page 131. 
Within each level, the spells are al- 
phabetically. At the start of each spell de- 
scription are the following important game 
statistics: 

Name: Each spell is identified by name. In 
parentheses after the name is the school (for 
wizard spells) to which that spell belongs. 
When more than one is listed, that spell is 
common to all schools given. 

Some spells are reversible (they can be 
cast for an effect opposite to that of the 
standard spell). This is noted after the spell 
name. Priests with reversible spells must 
memorize the desired version. For example, 
a priest who desires a cause light wounds 
spell must petition for this form of the spell 
when meditating and praying. Note that se- 
vere penalties can result if the spell choice is 
at variance with the priest's alignment (pos- 
sible penalties include denial of specific 
spells, entire spell levels, or even all spells 
for a certain period. The exact result (if any) 
depends on the reaction of the priest’s pa- 
tron deity, as determined by the DM. 

Reversible wizard spells operate similarly. 
When the spell is learned, both forms are re- 
corded in the wizard’s spell books. How- 
ever, the wizard must decide which version 
of the spell he desires to cast when memoriz- 
ing the spell, unless the spell description spe- 
cifically states otherwise. For example, a 
wizard who has memorized stone to flesh 
and desires to cast flesh to stone must wait 
until the latter form of the spell can be mem- 
orized (i.e., rest eight hours and study). If he 
can memorize two 6th-level spells, he could 
memorize each version once or one version 
twice. 

School: In parentheses after the spell 
name is the name of the school of magic to 
which the spell belongs. For wizard spells, 
this defines which spells a wizard specialist 
can learn, depending on the wizard’s school 
of specialization. For priest spells, the 
school notation is used only for reference 
purposes, to indicate which school the spell 
is considered to belong to, in case the DM 
needs to know for spell resistance (e.g., 
elves’ resistance to charm spells). 

Sphere: This entry appears only for priest 
spells and identifies the sphere or spheres 
into which each spell falls. 

Range: This lists the distance from the 
caster at which the spell effect occurs or be- 
gins. A “0” indicates the spell can be used on 
the caster only, with the effect embodied 
within or emanating from him. “Touch” 
means the caster can use the spell on others 
if he can physically touch them. Unless oth- 
erwise specified, all other spells are centered 
on a point visible to the caster and within 
the range of the spell. The point can be a 


creature or object if desired. In general, a 
spell that affects a limited number of crea- 
tures within an area affects those closest to 
the center first, unless there are other pa- 
rameters operating (such as level or Hit 
Dice). Spells can be cast through narrow 
openings only if both the caster’s vision and 
the spell energy can be directed simultane- 
ously through the opening. A wizard stand- 
ing behind an arrow slit can cast through it; 
sending a fireball through a small peephole 
he is peering through is another matter. 

Components: This lists the category of 
components needed, V for verbal, S for so- 
matic, and M for material. When material 
components are required, these are listed in 
the spell description. Spell components are 
expended as the spell is cast, unless other- 
wise noted. Clerical holy symbols are not 
lost when a spell is cast. For cases in which 
material components are expended at the 
end of the spell (free action, shapechange, 
etc.), premature destruction of the compo- 
nents ends the spell. 

Duration: This lists how long the magical 
energy of the spell lasts. Spells of instanta- 
neous duration come and go the moment 
they are cast, although the results of these 
spells may be permanent and unchangeable 
by normal means. Spells of permanent du- 
ration last until the effects are negated by 
some means, usually by a dispel magic. 
Some spells have a variable duration. The 
caster cannot choose the duration of spells, 
in most cases. Spells with set durations 
(e.g., 3 rounds/level of the wizard) must be 
kept track of by the player. Spells of varia- 
ble duration (e.g., 3 + 1d4 rounds) are se- 
cretly recorded by the DM. Your DM may 
warn you when spell durations are ap- 
proaching expiration, but there is usually no 
sign that a spell is going to expire; check 
with your DM to determine exactly how he 
handles this issue. 

Certain spells can be ended at will by the 
caster. In order to dismiss these spells, the 
original caster must be within range of the 
spell’s center of effect—within the same 
range at which the spell can be cast. The 
caster also must be able to speak words of 
dismissal. Note that only the original caster 
can dismiss his spells in this way. 

Casting Time: This entry is important, if 
the optional casting time modifier to initia- 
tive is used. If only a number is given, the 
casting time is added to the caster’s initiative 
die rolls. If the spell requires a round or 
number of rounds to cast, it goes into effect 
at the end of the last round of casting time. 
If Delsenora casts a spell that takes one 
round, it goes into effect at the end of the 
round in which she begins casting. If the 
spell requires three rounds to cast, it goes 
into effect at the end of the third round. 
Spells requiring a turn or more go into effect 
at the end of the stated turn. 

Area of Effect: This lists the creatures, 


129 


volume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can 
be affected by the spell. Spells with an area 
or volume that can be shaped by the caster 
will, unless the spell description specifically 
states otherwise, have a minimum dimen- 
sion of 10 feet in any direction. Thus a cloud 
that has a 10-foot cube per caster level 
might, when cast by a 12th-level caster, 
have dimensions 10’ X 10’ x 120’, 20’ x 
20' X 30’, or any similar combination that 
totals 12 10-foot cubes. Combinations such 
as 5’ X 10’ X 240’ are not possible unless 
specifically stated. 

Some spells (such as bless) affect the 
friends or enemies of the caster. In all cases, 
this refers to the perception of the caster at 
the time the spell is cast. For example, a cha- 
otic good character allied with a lawful neu- 
tral cleric would receive the benefits of the 
latter's bless spell. 

Saving Throw: This lists whether the spell 
allows the target a saving throw and ex- 
plains the effect of a successful save: “Neg.” 
results in the spell having no effect; “1/2” 
means the character suffers half the normal 
amount of damage; “none” means no saving 
throw is allowed. Wisdom adjustments to 
saving throws apply only to enchantment/ 
charm spells. 

Solid physical barriers provide saving 
throw bonuses and damage reduction. 
Cover and concealment may affect saving 
throws and damage (the DM has additional 
information about this). 

A creature that successfully saves against 
a spell with no apparent physical effect 
(such as a charm, hold, or magic jar) may 
feel a definite force or tingle that is charac- 
teristic of a magical attack, if the DM de- 
sires. But the exact hostile spell effect or 
creature ability used cannot be deduced 
from this tingle. 

A being’s carried equipment and posses- 
sions are assumed to make their saving 
throws against special attacks if the creature 
makes its saving throw, unless the spell spe- 
cifically states otherwise. If the creature fails 
its saving throw, or if the attack form is par- 
ticularly potent, saving throws may have to 
be rolled to see if any possessions survive, 
using either item saving throws (see the 
DMG) or the being’s saving throw. The DM 
will inform you when this happens. 

Any character can voluntarily forgo a 
saving throw. This allows a spell or similar 
attack that normally grants a saving throw 
to have full effect on the character. Like- 
wise, any creature can voluntarily lower its 
magic resistance allowing a spell to auto- 
matically function when cast on it. Forego- 
ing a saving throw or magic resistance roll 
need not always be voluntary. If a creature 
or character can be tricked into lowering its 
resistance, the spell will have full effect, 
even if it is not the spell the victim believed 
he was going to receive. The victim must 
consciously choose to lower his resistance; 


Notes on Spells 


it is not sufficient that he is caught off guard. 
For example, a character would receive a 
saving throw if a mage in the party suddenly 
attacked him with a fireball, even if the 
mage had been friendly to that point. How- 
ever, the same character would not receive a 
saving throw if the mage convinced him 
that he was about to receive a levitation 
spell but cast a fireball instead. Your DM 
will decide when NPCs have lowered their 
resistances. You must tell your DM when 
your character is lowering his resistance. 

Spell Description: The text provides a 
complete description of how the spell func- 
tions and its game effects. It covers most 
typical uses of the spell, if there are more 
than one, but cannot deal with every possi- 
ble application players might find. In these 
cases, the spell information in the text 
should provide guidance on how to adjudi- 
cate the situation. 

Spells with multiple functions enable the 
caster to select which function he wants to 
use at the time of casting. Usually a single 
function of a multiple-function spell is 
weaker than a single-function spell of the 
same level. 

Spell effects that give bonuses or penalties 
to abilities, attack rolls, damage rolls, sav- 
ing throws, etc., are not usually cumulative 
with each other or with other magic: the 
strongest single effect applies. For example, 
a fighter drinks a potion of giant strength 
and then receives the 2nd-level wizard spell 
strength. Only the strongest magic (the po- 
tion) is effective. When the potion’s dura- 
tion ends, however, the strength spell is still 
in effect, until its duration also expires. 


Adjudicating Illusions 


All illusions are 
cases of DM adjudication; each depends 
upon the exact situational factors deemed 
significant by the DM. All of the following 
points are only subsidiary guidelines to help 
the DM maintain consistency. 

Intrinsically Deadly Illusions: “Instant 
kill” illusions that are automatically fatal re- 
gardless of level, Hit Dice, or saving 
throws: collapsing ceilings, inescapable 
lava pits, etc. The absolute maximum effect 
of these is to force a system shock check. 
Surviving characters are not further af- 
fected by that illusion. 

Spell Effects: Illusions that duplicate spell 
effects are keyed to the caster’s level (e.g., a 
10th-level illusionist casting a fireball can 
create a convincing 10-die fireball). Exceed- 
ing this limit creates a fatal flaw in the illu- 
sion that negates its effect. 

Monster Special Attacks: Before the 
caster can effectively duplicate a monster's 
special attack, the wizard must have under- 
gone it (a wizard cannot conjure up the 
twinkle in a medusa’s eye correctly without 
actually experiencing it—i.e., having been 


turned to stone by one). 

Option: Illusionary monsters attack us- 
ing the wizard’s attack values. This would 
be a subtle clue that the monsters are fake. 

Option: Extend the spell level control to 
monsters—the caster can create monsters 
only if the total monster Hit Dice are equal 
to or less than the caster’s level (an 8th-level 
caster could convincingly do one hill giant, 
two ogres, or four 2nd-level fighters). 

Illusion spells require a higher degree of 
DM-player interaction than other wizard 
spells. The timing and staging of such spells 
by the caster are extremely important. Ef- 
fects that appear out of nowhere are not be- 
lieved unless the caster takes this into 
account. On the other hand, an illusionary 
fireball cast after a wizard has cast a real one 
could have devastating effects. 

The caster must maintain a show of real- 
ism at all times when conducting an illusion 
(if a squad of low-level fighters is created, 
the caster dictates their hits, misses, damage 
inflicted, apparent wounds, and so forth; 
the DM decides whether the bounds of be- 
lievability have been exceeded). 

NPC illusions require careful preparation 
by the DM, including clues to their nature. 


Intelligence is the best defense against illu- 
sions. Low and non-intelligent creatures are 
more vulnerable to illusions, unless the illu- 
sion is completely outside their experience 
or the illusion touches on an area of the 
creatures’ particular competence. Undead 
are generally immune to illusions, but they 
are vulnerable to quasi-real effects, most of 
which start to appear in the 4th-level spell 
list. 

Illusions usually cease to affect a charac- 
ter if they are actively disbelieved. Disbelief 
must be stated by the player, based on clues 
provided by the DM. Players stating disbe- 
lief must give a reason for disbelief based on 
sensory information available to the charac- 
ter. Failure to give such a reason results in 
failure to disbelieve. The DM can impose 
additional requirements or delays in recog- 
nizing illusions (such as Intelligence checks) 
as needed, such as when one player is obvi- 
ously parroting a discovery made by an- 
other. Disbelief automatically forfeits a 
saving throw if the effect is real. 

For NPCs, a saving throw, Intelligence 
check, or DM adjudication can be used to 
determine disbelief, whichever the DM 
deems appropriate.

First-Level Spells 


Affect Normal Fires (Alteration) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Componenrts: V, S 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the wizard to cause 
nonmagical fires—from as small as a torch 
or lantern to as large as the area of effect— 
to reduce in size and brightness to become 
mere coals or increase in light to become as 
bright as full daylight and increase the illu- 
mination to double the normal radius. Note 
that this does not affect either fuel consump- 
tion or damage caused by the fire. The 
caster can affect any or all fires in the spell’s 
area. He can alter their intensities with a sin- 
gle gesture as long as the spell is in effect. 
The spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all 
fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The 
caster can also extinguish all flames in the 
area, which expends the spell immediately. 
The spell does not affect fire elementals or 
similar creatures. 


Alarm (Abjuration, Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 4 hours + !/2 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Up to a 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: None 


When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard 
causes a selected area to react to the pres- 
ence of any creature larger than a normal 
rat—anything larger than about one-half 
cubic foot in volume or more than about 
three pounds in weight. The area of effect 
can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. 
As soon as any creature enters the warded 
area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it 
without speaking a password established by 
the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud 
ringing that can be heard clearly within a 
60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet 
for each interposing door and by 20 feet for 
each substantial interposing wall.) The 
sound lasts for one round and then ceases. 
Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do 
not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating 
creatures, invisible creatures, or incorpor- 
eal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can 
dismiss the alarm with a single word. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver 
wire. 


Appendix 3: Wizard Spells 


Armor (Conjuration) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard creates 
a magical field of force that serves as if it 
were scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has 
no effect on a person already armored or a 
creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is 
not cumulative with the shield spell, but it is 
cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case 
of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. 
The armor spell does not hinder movement, 
adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it 
prevent spellcasting. It lasts until success- 
fully dispelled or until the wearer sustains 
cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 
points +1 per level of the caster. (It is im- 
portant to note that the armor does not ab- 
sorb this damage. The armor merely grants 
an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full dam- 
age from any successful attacks.) Thus, the 
wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, 
then several minutes later sustain an addi- 
tional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell 
were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, 
it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is 
dispelled, the armor spell grants the wearer 
full benefits of the Armor Class gained. 

The material component is a piece of 
finely cured leather that has been blessed by 


a priest. 


Audible Glamer (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Hearing range 
Saving Throw: Special 


When the audible glamer spell is cast, the 
wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, 
at whatever distance he desires (within 
range), and seem to recede, approach, or 
remain at a fixed place as desired. The vol- 
ume of sound created, however, is directly 
related to the level of the spellcaster. The 
volume is based upon the lowest level at 
which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The 
noise of the audible glamer at this level is 
that of four men, maximum. Each addi- 
tional experience level of the wizard adds a 
like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard 
can have the spell cause sound equal to that 
of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, 
shouting, walking, marching, or running 
sounds can be created. The auditory illu- 
sion created by an audible glamer spell can 
be virtually any type of sound, but the rel- 
ative volume must be commensurate with 
the level of the wizard casting the spell. A 


131 


horde of rats running and squeaking is 
about the same volume as eight men run- 
ning and shouting. A roaring lion is equal 
to the noise volume of 16 men, while a 
roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume 
of no fewer than 24 men. 

A character stating that he does not be- 
lieve the sound receives a saving throw, and 
if it succeeds, the character then hears a 
faint and obviously false sound, emanating 
from the caster’s direction. Note that this 
spell can enhance the effectiveness of the 
phantasmal force spell. 

The material component of the spell is a 
bit of wool or a small lump of wax. 


Burning Hands (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: 1/2 


When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of 
searing flame shoots from his fingertips. His 
hands must be held so as to send forth a fan- 
like sheet of flames: the wizard’s thumbs 
must touch each other and fingers must be 
spread, The burning hands send out flame 
jets of five-foot length in a horizontal arc of 
about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. 
Any creature in the area of the flames suf- 
fers 1d3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points 
for each level of experience of the spell- 
caster, to a maximum of 1d3 + 20 points of 
fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. 
spell receive half damage. Flammable mate- 
rials touched by the fire burn (e.g., cloth, 
paper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such 
materials can be extinguished in the next 


round if no other action is taken. 


Cantrip (All Schools) 


Range: 10 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


Cantrips are minor spells studied by wiz- 
ards during their apprenticeship, regardless 
of school. The cantrip spell is a practice 
method for the apprentice, teaching him 
how to tap minute amounts of magical 
energy. Once cast, the cantrip spell enables 
the caster to create minor magical effects for 
the duration of the spell. So minor are these 
effects that they have severe limitations. 
They are completely unable to cause a loss 
of hit points, cannot affect the concentra- 
tion of spellcasters, and can only create 
small, obviously magical materials. Fur- 
thermore, materials created by a cantrip are 
extremely fragile and cannot be used as 


Ths 


tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the 
power to duplicate any other spell effects. 
Whatever manifestation the cantrip 
takes, it remains in effect only as long as the 
wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use 
cantrips to impress common folk, amuse 
children, and brighten dreary lives. Com- 
mon tricks with cantrips include tinklings of 
ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, 
glowing balls that float over the caster’s 
hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spic- 
ing up aromas and flavors of bland food, 
and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under 
rugs. Combined with the unseen servant 
spell, these are the tools to make housekeep- 
ing and entertaining simpler for the wizard. 


Change Self (Ilusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 2d6 rounds + 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: The caster 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the wizard to alter the 
appearance of his form—including clothing 
and equipment—to appear one foot shorter 
or taller; thin, fat, or in between; human, 
humanoid, or any other generally man- 
shaped bipedal creature. The caster cannot 
duplicate a specific individual. The spell 
does not provide the abilities or mannerisms 
of the chosen form. The duration of the spell 
is 2d6 rounds plus two additional rounds 
per level of experience of the spellcaster. The 
DM may allow a saving throw for disbelief 
under certain circumstances: for example, 
if the caster acts in a manner obviously 
inconsistent with his chosen role. The spell 
does not alter the perceived tactile (i.e., 
touch) properties of the caster or his equip- 
ment, and the ruse can be discovered in this 
way. 


Charm Person (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 120 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell affects any single person it is 
cast upon. The term person includes any 
bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid 
of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, 
dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, 
goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, 
hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, 
nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and 
others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be 
charmed, but an ogre could not. 

The person receives a saving throw vs. 
spell to avoid the effect, with any adjust- 
ment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the 


Wizard Spells (1st Level) 


person receives damage from the caster's 
group in the same round the charm is cast, 
an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of 
damage received is added to the victim's 
saving throw. 

If the spell recipient fails his saving 
throw, he regards the caster as a trusted 
friend and ally to be heeded and protected. 
The spell does not enable the caster to con- 
trol the charmed creature as if it were an 
automaton, but any word or action of the 
caster is viewed in the most favorable way. 
Thus, a charmed person would not obey a 
suicide command, but he might believe the 
caster if assured that the only chance to save 
the caster’s life is for the person to hold back 
an onrushing red dragon for “just a round or 
two.” Note also that the spell does not 
endow the caster with linguistic capabilities 
beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he 
must speak the victim's language to commu- 
nicate his commands). 

The duration of the spell is a function of 
the charmed person’s Intelligence and is tied 
to the saving throw. The spell may be bro- 
ken if a successful saving throw is rolled, 
and this saving throw is checked on a peri- 
odic basis, according to the creature's Intel- 
ligence (see the following table). If the caster 
harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed 
person by some overt action, or if a dispel 
magic spell is successfully cast upon the 
charmed person, the charm spell is broken. 

If two or more charm effects simultane- 
ously affect a creature, the result is decided 
by the DM. This could range from one effect 
being clearly dominant, to the subject being 
torn by conflicting desires, to new saving 
throws that could negate both spells. 

Note that the subject has full memory of 
the events that took place while he was 
charmed. 


Intelligence Score Time Between Checks 


3 or less 3 months 
4to6 2 months 
7to9 1 month 

10 to 12 3 weeks

Note: The period between checks is the 
time period during which the check occurs. 
When to roll the check during this time is 
determined (randomly or by selection) by 
the DM. The roll is made secretly. 


132 


Chill Touch (Necromancy) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: The caster 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


When the caster completes this spell, a 
blue glow encompasses his hand. This 
energy attacks the life force of any living 
creature upon which the wizard makes a 
successful melee attack. The touched crea- 
ture must roll a successful saving throw vs. 
spell or suffer 1d4 points of damage and lose 
1 point of Strength. If the save is successful, 
the creature remains unharmed, Creatures 
not rated for Strength suffer a —1 penalty to 
their attack rolls for every other successful 
touch. Lost Strength returns at the rate of 1 
point per hour. Damage must be cured mag- 
ically or healed naturally. 

This spell has a special effect on undead 
creatures. Undead touched by the caster suf- 
fer no damage or Strength loss, but they 
must successfully save vs. spell or flee for 
1d4 rounds + 1 round per level of the caster. 


Color Spray (Alteration) 


:0 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 5’ x 20' x 20’ wedge 
Saving Throw: Special 


Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes 
a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors 
to spring forth from his hand. From one to 
six creatures (1d6) within the area are affect- 
ed in order of increasing distance from the 
wizard. All creatures above the level of the 
spellcaster and all those of 6th level or 6 Hit 
Dice or more are entitled to a saving throw 
vs. spell. Blind or unseeing creatures are not 
affected by the spell. 

Creatures not allowed or failing saving 
throws, and whose Hit Dice or levels are less 
than or equal to the spellcaster’s level, are 
struck unconscious for 2d4 rounds; those 
with Hit Dice or levels 1 or 2 greater than 
the wizard’s level are blinded for 1d4 
rounds; those with Hit Dice or levels 3 or 
more greater than that of the spellcaster are 
stunned (reeling and unable to think or act 
coherently) for one round. 

The material components of this spell are 
a pinch each of powder or sand that is col- 
ored red, yellow, and blue. 


Wizard Spells (ist Level) 


Comprehend Languages (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 5 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 speaking creature or 
written object 

Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard is able 
to understand the spoken words of a crea- 
ture or read an otherwise incomprehensible 
written message (such as writing in another 
language). In either case, the wizard must 
touch the creature or the writing. Note that 
the ability to read does not necessarily 
impart understanding of the material, nor 
does the spell enable the caster to speak or 
write an unknown language. Written mate- 
rial can be read at the rate of one page or 
equivalent per round. Magical writing can- 
not be read, other than to know it is magi- 
cal, but the spell is often useful when 
deciphering treasure maps. This spell can be 
foiled by certain warding magics (the 3rd- 
level secret page and illusionary script 
spells) and it does not reveal messages con- 
cealed in otherwise normal text. 

The material components of this spell are 
a pinch of soot and a few grains of salt. 

The reverse of this spell, confuse languag- 
es, cancels a comprehend languages spell or 
renders a writing or a creature's speech 
incomprehensible, for the same duration as 
above. 


Dancing Lights (Alteration) 


Range: 40 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


When a dancing lights spell is cast, the 
wizard creates, at his option, from one to 
four lights that resemble either torches or 
lanterns (and cast that amount of light), 
glowing spheres of light (such as evidenced 
by will-o-wisps), or one faintly glowing, 
vaguely man-like shape, somewhat similar 
to that of a creature from the elemental 
plane of Fire. The dancing lights move as the 
spellcaster desires, forward or back, 
straight or turning corners, without concen- 
tration upon such movement by the wizard. 
The spell cannot be used to cause blindness 
(see 1st-level light spell), and it winks out if 
the range or duration is exceeded. 

The material component of this spell is 
either a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or 
a glowworm. 


Detect Magic (Divination) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 10’ path, 60’ long 
Saving Throw: None 


When the detect magic spell is cast, the 
wizard detects magical radiations in a path 
10 feet wide and up to 60 feet long, in the 
direction he is facing. The intensity of the 
magic can be determined (dim, faint, mod- 
erate, strong, overwhelming), and the wiz- 
ard has a 10% chance per level to recognize 
if a certain type of magic (alteration, conju- 
ration, etc.) is present. The caster can turn, 
scanning a 60-degree arc per round. A stone 
wall of one foot or more thickness, solid 
metal of one inch thickness, or a yard or 
more of solid wood blocks the spell. Magi- 
cal areas, multiple types of magic, or strong 
local magical emanations may confuse or 
conceal weaker radiations. Note that this 
spell does not reveal the presence of good or 
evil, or reveal alignment. Other-planar 
creatures are not necessarily magical. 


Detect Undead 
(Divination, Necromancy) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 3 turns 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 60’ + 10'/level 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to detect all 
undead creatures out to the range of the 
spell. The area of effect extends in a path 10 
feet wide and 60 feet long (plus 10 feet long- 
er per level of the wizard), in the direction 
the caster is facing. Scanning a direction 
requires one round, and the caster must be 
motionless. While the spell indicates direc- 
tion, it does not give specific location or dis- 
tance. It detects undead through walls and 
obstacles but is blocked by one foot of solid 
stone, one yard of wood or loose earth, or a 
thin coating of metal. The spell does not 
indicate the type of undead detected, only 
that undead are present. 

The material component for this spell is a 
bit of earth from a grave. 


133 


Enlarge (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 5 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature or object 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell causes instant growth of a crea- 
ture or object, increasing both size and 
weight. It can be cast only upon a single 
creature (or a symbiotic or community enti- 
ty) or upon a single object that does not 
exceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster 
level. The object or creature must be seen to 
be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level 
of experience of the wizard, increasing this 
amount in height, width, and weight. 

All equipment worn or carried by a crea- 
ture is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling vic- 
tims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. 
A successful saving throw means the spell 
fails. If insufficient room is available for the 
desired growth, the creature or object 
attains the maximum possible size, bursting 
weak enclosures in the process, but it is con- 
strained without harm by stronger 
materials—the spell cannot be used to crush 
a creature by growth. 

Magical properties are not increased by 
this spell—a huge sword +1 isstill only +1, 
a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its 
normal functions, a giant-sized potion 
merely requires a greater fluid intake to 
make its magical effects operate, etc. 
Weight, mass, and strength are affected, 
though, Thus, a table blocking a door 
would be heavier and more effective, a 
hurled stone would have more mass (and 
cause more damage), chains would be more 
massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to 
a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A crea- 
ture's hit points, Armor Class, and attack 
rolls do not change, but damage rolls 
increase proportionately with size. For 
example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits 
with his long sword and rolls a 6 for dam- 
age. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 
6x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up), Bonuses due to 
Strength, class, and magic are not altered. 

The reverse spell, reduce, negates the 
enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects 
smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of 
its original size for every level of the caster, 
to a minimum of 10% of the original size. 
Thereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot 
increments to less than one foot, by one- 
inch increments to one inch, and by '/10- 
inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an 
inch—the recipient cannot dwindle away to 
nothingness. For example, a 16-foot-tall 
giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 
steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine 
steps), then to ®/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in 
one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the 


Wizard Spells (ist Level) 


last five steps). A shrinking object may 
weaker materials affixed to it, but 
an object will shrink only as long as the ob- 
ject itself is not damaged. Unwilling crea- 
tures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. 
The material component of this spell is a 
pinch of powdered iron. 


Erase (Alteration) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 scroll or 2 pages 
Saving Throw: Special 


The erase spell removes writings of either 
magical or mundane nature from a scroll or 
from one to two pages of paper, parchment, 
or similar surfaces. It removes explosive 
runes, glyphs of warding, sepia snake sigils, 
and wizard marks, but it does not remove il- 
lusory script or symbols (see these spells). 
Nonmagical writings are automatically 
erased if the caster is touching them, other- 
wise the chance for success is 90% . Magical 
writings must be touched, and are only 30% 
likely to be erased, plus 5% per caster level, 
to a maximum of 90% (e.g., 35% for a Ist- 
level caster, 40% for a 2nd-level caster, 
etc.). 


Feather Fall (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or 
object(s) affected immediately assumes the 
mass of a piece of down. Rate of falling is in- 
stantly changed to a mere two feet per sec- 
ond (120 feet per round), and no damage is 
incurred upon landing while the spell is in 
effect. However, when the spell duration 
ceases, normal rate of fall occurs. The spell 
can be cast upon the wizard or some other 
creature or object up to the maximum range 
and lasts for one round for each level of the 
wizard. The feather fall affects one or more 
objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as 
long as the maximum weight of the crea- 
tures or objects does not exceed a combined 
total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per 
level of the spellcaster. 

For example, a 2nd-level wizard has a 
range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, 
and a weight limit of 600 pounds when cast- 
ing this spell. The spell works only upon 
free-falling, flying, or propelled objects 
(such as missiles). It does not affect a sword 
blow or a charging creature. Note that the 
spell can be effectively combined with gust 
of wind and similar spells. 


Find Familiar (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 1 mile/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2d12 hours 
Area of Effect: 1 familiar 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell enables the caster to attempt to 
summon a familiar to act as his aide and 
companion. Familiars are typically small 
creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, 
hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, wea- 
sels, or even mice. A creature acting as a fa- 
miliar can benefit a wizard, conveying its 
sensory powers to its master, conversing 
with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy 
as well. A wizard can have only one familiar 
at a time, however, and he has no control 
over what sort of creature answers the sum- 
moning, if any at all come. 

The creature is always more intelligent 
than others of its type (typically 2 or 3 Int 
points), and its bond with the wizard con- 
fers upon it an exceptionally long life. The 
wizard receives the heightened senses of his 
familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bo- 
nus to all surprise die rolls. Normal famil- 
iars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per 
caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to 
size, speed, etc.). 

The wizard has an empathic link with the 
familiar and can issue it mental commands 
at a distance of up to one mile. Note that 
empathic responses from the familiar are 
generally fairly basic—while able to com- 
municate simple thoughts, these are often 
overwhelmed by instinctual responses. 
Thus a ferret familiar spying on a band of 
orcs in the woods might lose its train of 
thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly 
its communications to its master would be 
tinged with fear of the “big ones” it was spy- 
ing on! The caster cannot see through the fa- 
miliar’s eyes. 

If separated from the caster, the familiar 
loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if re- 
duced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in 
physical contact with its wizard, it gains the 
wizard’s saving throws against special at- 
tacks. If a special attack would normally 
cause damage, the familiar suffers no dam- 
age if the saving throw is successful and half 
damage if the saving throw is failed. If the 
familiar dies, the wizard must successfully 
roll an immediate system shock check or 
die. Even if he survives this check, the wiz- 
ard loses 1 point from his Constitution 
when the familiar dies. 

The power of the conjuration is such that 
it can be attempted but once per year. When 
the wizard decides to find a familiar, he 
must load a brass brazier with charcoal. 
When this is burning well, he adds 1,000 gp 
worth of incense and herbs. The spell incan- 
tation is then begun and must be continued 


134 


until the familiar comes or the casting time 
is finished. The DM secretly determines all 
results. Note that most familiars are not in- 
herently magical, nor does a dispel magic 
spell send them away. 

Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed 
and care for the familiar, or continuous un- 
reasonable demands have adverse effects on 
the familiar’s relationship with its master. 
Purposely arranging the death of one’s own 
familiar incurs great disfavor from certain 
powerful entities, with dire results.

Friends (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 60-foot radius 

Saving Throw: Special 


A friends spell causes the wizard to tem- 
porarily gain 2d4 points of Charisma. Intel- 
ligent creatures within the area of effect at 
the time the spell is cast must make immedi- 
ate reaction checks based on the character's 
new Charisma. Those with favorable reac- 
tions tend to be very impressed with the 
spellcaster and make an effort to be his 
friends and help him, as appropriate to the 
situation. Officious bureaucrats might de- 
cide to become helpful; surly gate guards 
might wax informative; attacking orcs 
might spare the caster’s life, taking him cap- 
tive instead. When the spell wears off, the 
creatures realize that they have been influ- 
enced, and their reactions are determined by 
the DM. 

The components for this spell are chalk 
(or white flour), lampblack (or soot), and 
vermilion applied to the face before casting 
the spell. 


Wizard Spells (1st Level) 


Gaze Reflection (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


The gaze reflection spell creates a shim- 
mering, mirror-like area of air before the 
wizard that moves with the caster. Any gaze 
attack, such as that of a basilisk, eyes of 
charming, a vampire's gaze, the 6th-level 
eyebite spell, and so on, is reflected back 
upon the gazer if the gazer tries to make eye 
contact with the spellcaster (the spellcaster 
suffers no effects from the gaze attack). 
Such creatures receive a saving throw vs. 
their own gaze effect. The spell does not 
affect vision or lighting and is not effective 
against creatures whose effect comes from 
being gazed upon (such as a medusa). Only 
active gaze attacks are blocked by this spell. 


Grease (Conjuration) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 10’ X 10' square area 
Saving Throw: Special 


A grease spell covers a material surface 
with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy 
nature. Any creature entering the area or 
caught in it when the spell is cast must save 
vs. spell or slip, skid, and fall. Those who 
successfully save can reach the nearest non- 
greased surface by the end of the round. 
Those who remain in the area are allowed a 
saving throw each round until they escape 
the area. The DM should adjust saving 
throws by circumstance; for example, a 
creature charging down an incline that is 
suddenly greased has little chance to avoid 
the effect, but its ability to exit the affected 
area is almost assured! The spell can also be 
used to create a greasy coating on an item— 
a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. 
Material objects not in use are always 
affected by this spell, while creatures wield- 
ing or employing items receive a saving 
throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the ini- 
tial saving throw is failed, the creature 
immediately drops the item. A saving throw 
must be made each round the creature 
attempts to use the greased item. The caster 
can end the effect with a single utterance; 
otherwise it lasts for three rounds plus one 
round per level. 

The material component of the spell is a 
bit of pork rind or butter. 


Hold Portal (Alteration) 


Range: 20 yards/level 
Component: V 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 20 square feet/level 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell magically bars a door, gate, or 
valve of wood, metal, or stone. The magical 
closure holds the portal fast, just as if it were 
securely closed and locked. Any extra- 
planar creature (djinn, elemental, etc.) with 
4 or more Hit Dice can shatter the spell and 
burst open the portal. A wizard of 4 or more 
experience levels higher than the spellcaster 
can open the held portal at will. A knock 
spell or a successful dispel magic spell can 
negate the hold portal. Held portals can be 
broken or physically battered down. 


Hypnotism (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 5 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The gestures of the wizard, along with his 
droning incantation, cause 1d6 creatures 
within the area to become susceptible to a 
suggestion—a brief and _ reasonable- 
sounding request (see the 3rd-level wizard 
suggestion spell). The request must be given 
after the hypnotism spell is cast. Until that 
time the success of the spell is unknown. 
Note that the subsequent suggestion is not a 
spell, but simply a vocalized urging (the 
caster must speak a language the creature 
understands for this spell to work). Crea- 
tures that successfully roll their saving 
throws are not under hypnotic influence. 
Those who are exceptionally wary or hostile 
save with +1 to +3 bonuses. If the spell is 
cast at an individual creature that meets the 
caster’s gaze, the saving throw is made with 
a penalty of —2. A creature that fails its sav- 
ing throw does not remember that the caster 
enspelled it. 


identify (Divination) 


Range: 0 

Components; V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: 1 item/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When an identify spell is cast, magical 
items subsequently touched by the wizard 
can be identified. The eight hours immedi- 
ately preceding the casting of the spell must 
be spent purifying the items and removing 
influences that would corrupt and blur their 


135 


magical auras. If this period is interrupted, 
it must be begun again. When the spell is 
cast, each item must be handled in turn by 
the wizard. Any consequences of this han- 
dling fall fully upon the wizard and may end 
the spell, although the wizard is allowed 
any applicable saving throw. 

The chance of learning a piece of informa- 
tion about an item is equal to 10% per level 
of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled 
by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a 
false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only 
one function of a multi-function item is dis- 
covered per handling (i.e., a Sth-level wiz- 
ard could attempt to determine the nature of 
five different items, five different functions 
of a single item, or any combination of the 
two). If any attempt at reading fails, the 
caster cannot learn any more about that 
item until he advances a level. Note that 
some items, such as special magical tomes, 
cannot be identified with this spell 

The item never reveals its exact attack or 
damage bonuses, although the fact that it has 
few or many bonuses can be determined. If it 
has charges, only a general indication of the 
number of charges remaining is learned: pow- 
erful (81%-100% of the total possible 
charges), strong (61%-80%), moderate (41%- 
60%), weak (6%-40%), or faint (five charges 
or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a 
fully charged ring of three wishes always 
appears to be only faintly 

After casting the spell and determining 
what can be learned from it, the wizard 
loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest 
for one hour to recover each point of Con- 
stitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spell- 
caster below a Constitution of 1, he falls 
unconscious, Consciousness is not regained 
until full Constitution is restored, which 
takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for 
an unconscious character). 

The material components of this spell are 
a pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl 
feather steeped in wine, with the infusion 
drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is 
powdered and added to the infusion, the 
divination becomes much more potent: 
exact bonuses or charges can be determined, 
and the functions of a multi-functional item 
can be learned from a single reading. At the 
DM's option, certain properties of an arti- 
fact or relic might also be learned. 


Jump (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1d3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The individual touched when this spell is 
cast is empowered to leap once per round 
for the duration of the spell. Leaps can be up 


Wizard Spells (1st Level) 


to 30 feet forward or straight upward or 10 
feet backward. Horizontal leaps forward or 
backward have only a slight arc—about 
two feet per 10 feet of distance traveled. The 
jump spell does not ensure safety in landing 
or grasping at the end of the leap. 

The material component of this spell is a 
grasshopper’s hind leg, to be broken by the 
caster when the spell is cast. 


Light (Alteration) 


Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell creates a luminous glow, equal 
to torchlight, within a fixed radius of the 
spell’s center. Objects in darkness beyond 
this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and 
shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a 
point selected by the caster, and he must 
have a line of sight and unobstructed path 
for the spell when it is cast. Light can spring 
from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any 
similar substance. 

The effect is immobile unless it is specifi- 
cally centered on a moveable object or 
mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a 
creature, the applicable magic resistance 
and saving throw rolls must be made. Suc- 
cessful resistance negates the spell, while a 
successful saving throw indicates that the 
spell is centered immediately behind the 
creature, rather than upon the creature 
itself. Light taken into an area of magical 
darkness does not function, but if cast 
directly against magical darkness negates it 
(but only for the duration of the light spell, 
if the darkness effect is continual). 

Light centered on the visual organs of a 
creature blinds it, reducing its attack rolls 
and saving throws by 4 and worsening its 
Armor Class by 4. The caster can end the 
spell at any time by uttering a single word. 

The material component is a firefly or a 
piece of phosphorescent moss. 


Magic Missile (Evocation) 


Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Instantaneous 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures 
in a 10-foot cube 

Saving Throw: None 


Use of the magic missile spell creates up to 
five missiles of magical energy that dart 
forth from the wizard’s fingertip and unerr- 
ingly strike their target. This includes ene- 
my creatures in a melee. The target creature 
must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, 
however, so near-total concealment, such as 


that offered by arrow slits, can render the 
spell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must 
be able to identify the target. He cannot 
direct a magic missile to “Strike the com- 
mander of the legion,’ unless he can single 
out the commander from the rest of the sol- 
diers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be 
singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) 
cannot be damaged by the spell, and any 
attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no 
effect. Against creatures, each missile 
inflicts 1d4 +1 points of damage. 

For every two extra levels of experience, 
the wizard gains an additional missile—he 
has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four 
at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles 
at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple mis- 
sile capability, he can have them strike a sin- 
gle target creature or several creatures, as 
desired, 


Mending (Alteration) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 object 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell repairs small breaks or tears in 
objects. It will weld a broken ring, chain 
link, medallion, or slender dagger, provid- 
ing but one break exists. Ceramic or wood- 
en objects with multiple breaks can be 
invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A 
hole in a leather sack or wineskin is com- 
pletely healed over by a mending spell. This 
spell does not, by itself, repair magical items 
of any type. One turn after the spell is cast, 
the magic of the joining fades, and the effect 
cannot be magically dispelled. The maxi- 
mum volume of material the caster can 
mend is one cubic foot per level. 

The material components of this spell are 
two small magnets of any type (lodestone in 
all likelihood) or two burrs. 


Message (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard can 
whisper messages and receive replies with 
little chance of being overheard. When the 
spell is cast, the wizard secretly or openly 
points his finger at each creature to be 
included in the spell effect. Up to one crea- 
ture per level can be included. When the 
wizard whispers, the whispered message 
travels in a straight line and is audible to all 
of the involved creatures within 30 feet, plus 
10 feet per level of the caster. The creatures 


136 


who receive the message can whisper a reply 
that is heard by the spellcaster. Note that 
there must be an unobstructed path between 
the spellcaster and the recipients of the spell. 
The message must be in a language the cast- 
er speaks; this spell does not by itself confer 
understanding upon the recipients. This 
spell is most often used to conduct quick 
and private conferences when the caster 
does not wish to be overheard. 

The material component of the spell is a 
short piece of copper drawn fine. 


Mount (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 hours + 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 1 mount 

Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster conjures 
a normal animal to serve him as a mount. 
The animal serves willingly and well, but at 
the expiration of the spell duration it disap- 
pears, returning to its own place. The type 
of mount gained by this spell depends on the 
level of the caster; of course, a caster can 
choose a lesser mount if desired. Available 
mounts include the following: 


Caster Level Mount 
1st-3rd level Mule or light horse 
4th-7th level Draft horse or 
war horse 
8th-12th level Camel 
13th-14th level Elephant (and 
howdah at 18th level) 
15th level & up Griffon (and saddle at 
18th level) 


The mount does not come with any riding 
gear, unless it is of a class lower than the 
caster would normally be entitled to; thus a 
4th-level wizard can gain a war horse with- 
out saddle and harness, or a light horse with 
saddle and harness. The statistics of the ani- 
mal gained are typical of all creatures of the 
same class. The mount disappears when 
slain. 

The material component of the spell is a 
bit of hair from the type of animal to be con- 
jured. 


Nystul’s Magical Aura 
(Ilusion/Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 day/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


By means of this spell, any one item of no 
more than five pounds weight per level of 
the spellcaster can be given an aura that is 


Wizard Spells (1st Level) 


noticed by someone using magic detection. 
Furthermore, the caster can specify the type 
of magical aura that is detected (alteration, 
conjuration, etc.) and this effectively masks 
the item’s actual aura, if any, unless the 
item‘s own aura is exceptionally powerful (if 
it is an artifact, for instance). If the object 
bearing Nystul’s magical aura has an iden- 
tify spell cast on it or is similarly examined, 
the examiner has a 50% chance of recogniz- 
ing that the aura has been placed to mislead 
the unwary. Otherwise, the aura is believed 
and no amount of testing reveals what the 
true magic is. 

The component for this spell is a small 
square of silk, which must be passed over 
the object that receives the aura. 


Phantasmal! Force (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 400 sq. ft. + 100 sq. ft./level 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell creates the illusion of any 
object, creature, or force, as long as it is 
within the boundaries of the spell’s area of 
effect. The illusion is visual and affects all 
believing creatures (undead are immune) 
that view it. It does not create sound, smell, 
or temperature. Effects that depend on these 
senses usually fail. The illusion lasts until 
struck by an opponent—unless the spell- 
caster causes the illusion to react 
appropriately—or until the wizard ceases 
concentration upon the spell (due to desire, 
moving, or a successful attack that causes 
damage). Saving throws for illusions are 
explained under Illusion in the Magic chap- 
ter (page 80) and on page 130. Creatures 
that disbelieve the illusion see it for what it 
is and add +4 to associates’ saving throws if 
this knowledge can be communicated effec- 
tively. Creatures believing the illusion are 
subject to its effects, again as explained 
under Illusions. 

The illusionary effect can be moved by 
the caster within the limits of the area: of 
effect. The DM has to rule on the effective- 
ness of this spell; detailed guidelines are out- 
lined on page 130 and in Chapter 7: Magic. 

The material component of the spell is a 
bead of fleece. 


Protection From Evil (Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


Wher this spell is cast, it creates a magical 
barrier around the recipient at a distance of 
one foot. The barrier moves with the recipi- 
ent and has three major effects: 

First, all attacks made by evil (or evilly 
enchanted) creatures against the protected 
creature suffer —2 penalties to attack rolls; 
any saving throws caused by such attacks 
are made with +2 bonuses. 

Second, any attempt to possess (as by a 
magic jar attack) or to exercise mental con- 
trol over (as by a vampire’s charm ability) 
the protected creature is blocked by this 
spell. Note that the protection does not pre- 
vent a vampire's charm itself, but it does 
prevent the exercise of mental control 
through the barrier, Likewise, a possessing 
life force is merely kept out. It would not be 
expelled if in place before the protection is 
cast. 

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact 
by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured 
nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, 
imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water 
weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the 
natural (body) weapon attacks of such crea- 
tures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if 
such attacks require touching the protected 
being. Animals or monsters summoned or 
conjured by spells or similar magic are like- 
wise hedged from the character. 

This protection ends if the protected char- 
acter makes a melee attack against or tries to 
force the barrier against the blocked crea- 
ture. 

To complete this spell, the wizard must 
trace a three-foot-diameter circle on the 
floor (or ground) with powdered silver. 

This spell can be reversed to become pro- 
tection from good; the second and third 
benefits remaining unchanged. The material 
component for the reverse is a circle of pow- 
dered iron. 


Read Magic (Divination) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of a read magic spell, the wiz- 
ard is able to read magical inscriptions on 
objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the 
like—that would otherwise be totally unin- 
telligible. (The personal books of the wiz- 


137 


ard, and works already magically read, are 
intelligible.) This deciphering does not nor- 
mally invoke the magic contained in the 
writing, although it may do so in the case of 
a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell 
is cast and the wizard has read the magical 
inscription, he is thereafter able to read that 
particular writing without recourse to the 
use of the read magic spell. The duration of 
the spell is two rounds per level of experi- 
ence of the spellcaster; the wizard can read 
one page or its equivalent per round. 

The wizard must have a clear crystal or 
mineral prism, which is not expended, to 
cast the spell. 


Shield (Evocation) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier 
comes into being in front of the wizard. This 
shield totally negates magic missile attacks. 
It provides the equivalent protection of AC 
2 against hand-hurled missiles (axes, darts, 
javelins, spears, etc.), AC 3 against small 
device-propelled missiles (arrows, bolts, 
bullets, manticore spikes, sling stones, etc.), 
and AC 4 against all other forms of attack. 
The shield also adds a +1 bonus to the wiz- 
ard's saving throws against attacks that are 
basically frontal. Note that these benefits 
apply only if the attacks originate from in 
front of the wizard, where the shield can 
move to interpose itself. 


Shocking Grasp (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When the wizard casts this spell, he 
develops a powerful electrical charge that 
gives a jolt to the creature touched. The 
spell remains in effect for one round per 
level of the caster or until it is discharged by 
the caster touching another creature. The 
shocking grasp delivers 1d8 points of dam- 
age, plus 1 point per level of the wizard 
(e.g., a 2nd-level wizard would discharge a 
shock causing 1d8+2 points of damage). 
While the wizard must come close enough 
to his opponent to lay a hand on the oppo- 
nent’s body or upon an electrical conductor 
that touches the opponent's body, a like 
touch from the opponent does not discharge 
the spell. 


Wizard Spells (1st Level) 


Sleep (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When a wizard casts a sleep spell, he 
causes a comatose slumber to come upon 
one or more creatures (other than undead 
and certain other creatures specifically 
excluded from the spell’s effects). All crea- 
tures to be affected by the sleep spell must be 
within 30 feet of each other. The number of 
creatures that can be affected is a function of 
Hit Dice or levels. The spell affects 2d4 Hit 
Dice of monsters. Monsters with 4+3 Hit 
Dice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more 
are unaffected. The center of the area of 
effect is determined by the spellcaster. The 
creatures with the least Hit Dice are affected 
first, and partial effects are ignored. 

For example, a wizard casts sleep at three 
kobolds, two gnolls, and an ogre. The roll 
(2d4) result is 4. All the kobolds and one 
gnoll are affected (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2 = 31/2 
Hit Dice). Note that the remainder is not 
enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre. 

Slapping or wounding awakens affected 
creatures but normal noise does not. Awak- 
ening requires one entire round. Magically 
sleeping opponents can be attacked with 
substantial bonuses (see Combat, page 90). 

The material component for this spell is a 
pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live 
cricket. 


Spider Climb (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A spider climb spell enables the recipient 
to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as 
well as a giant spider, or even hang upside 
down from ceilings. Unwilling victims must 
be touched and are then allowed a saving 
throw vs. spell to negate the effect. The 
affected creature must have bare hands and 
feet in order to climb in this manner, at a 
movement rate of 6 (3 if at all encumbered). 
During the course of the spell, the recipient 
cannot handle objects that weigh less than a 
dagger (one pound), for such objects stick to 
his hands and feet. Thus a wizard will find it 
virtually impossible to cast spells if under a 
spider climb spell. Sufficient force can pull 
the recipient free; the DM can assign a sav- 
ing throw based on circumstances, the 
strength of the force, and so on. For exam- 
ple, a creature with a Strength of 12 might 
pull the subject free if the subject fails a sav- 


ing throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately 
difficult saving throw). The caster can end 
the spell effect with a word. 

The material components of this spell are 
a drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of 
which must be eaten by the spell recipient. 


Spook (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature within 30 feet 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A spook spell enables the wizard to play 
upon natural fears to cause the target crea- 
ture to perceive the spellcaster as someone 
or something inimical. Without actually 
knowing what this is, the wizard merely 
advances threateningly upon the creature. If 
a successful saving throw vs. spell is not 
made, the creature turns and flees at maxi- 
mum speed as far from the wizard as possi- 
ble, though items carried are not dropped. 
The creature has a saving throw penalty of 
—1 for every two experience levels of the 
the caster, to a maximum of —6 at 12th 
level. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll 
of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of 
saving throw penalties. Although the caster 
does not actually pursue the fleeing crea- 
ture, a phantasm from its own mind does. 
Each round after the initial casting, the crea- 
ture receives another saving throw, without 
penalty, until it successfully saves and the 
spell is broken. In any event, the spell func- 
tions only against creatures with Intelli- 
gences of 2 or more, and undead are not 
affected at all. 


Taunt (Enchantment) 


Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A taunt spell enables the caster to jape 
and jeer effectively at a single type of crea- 
ture with an Intelligence of 2 or greater. The 
caster need not speak the language of the 
creatures. His words and sounds have real 
meaning for the subject creature or crea- 
tures: challenging, insulting, and generally 
irritating and angering the listeners. Those 
failing to save vs. spell rush forth in fury to 
do battle with the spellcaster. All affected 
creatures attack the spellcaster in melee if 
physically capable of doing so, seeking to 
use body or hand-held weapons rather than 
missile weapons or spells. Separation of the 
caster from the victim by an impenetrable 
or uncrossable boundary (a wall of fire, a 
deep chasm, a formation of set pikemen) 


138 


causes the spell to break. If the caster taunts 
a mixed group, he must choose the type of 
creature to be affected. Creatures com- 
manded by a strong leader (i.e., with a Cha- 
risma bonus, with higher Hit Dice, etc.) 
might gain a saving throw bonus of +1 to 
+4, at the DM's discretion. If used in con- 
junction with a ventriloquism spell, the 
creatures may attack the apparent source, 
depending upon their Intelligence, a leader's 
presence, and so on. 

The material component is a slug, which 
is hurled at the creatures to be taunted. 


Tenser’s Floating Disc (Evocation) 


Range: 20 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 turns + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


With this spell, the caster creates the 
slightly concave, circular plane of force 
known as Tenser’s floating disc (after the 
famed wizard whose greed and ability to 
locate treasure are well known). The disc is 
three feet in diameter and holds 100 pounds 
of weight per level of the wizard casting the 
spell. The disc floats at approximately three 
feet above the ground at all times and 
remains level. It floats along horizontally 
within its range of 20 yards at the command 
of the caster, and will accompany him at a 
movement rate of no more than 6. If 
unguided, it maintains a constant interval of 
six feet between itself and the wizard, If the 
spellcaster moves beyond range (by moving 
faster, or by such means as a teleport spell, 
or by trying to take it more than three feet 
from the surface beneath it), or if the spell 
duration expires, the floating disc winks out 
of existence and whatever it was supporting 
crashes to the surface beneath it. 

The material component of the spell is a 
drop of mercury. 


Unseen Servant 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


The unseen servant is a non-visible, 
mindless, and shapeless force, used to step 
and fetch, open unstuck doors, and hold 
chairs, as well as to clean and mend. It is not 
strong, but unfailingly obeys the command 
of the wizard. It can carry out only one 
activity at a time and can move only light- 
weight items—carry a maximum of 20 
pounds or push or pull 40 pounds across a 


Wizard Spells (2nd Level) 


smooth surface. It can open only normal 
doors, drawers, lids, etc. The unseen ser- 
vant cannot fight, nor can it be killed, as it is 
a force rather than a creature. It can be mag- 
ically dispelled, or eliminated after receiv- 
ing 6 points of damage from area-effect 
spells, breath weapons, or similar attacks. If 
the caster attempts to send it beyond the 
allowed radius, the spell ends immediately. 

The material components of the spell are 
a piece of string and a bit of wood. 


Ventriloquism (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards/level, maximum 90 yards 
Components: V, M 

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature or object 

Saving Throw: Special 


This spell enables the wizard to make his 
voice—or someone else's voice—or a simi- 
lar sound seem to issue from someplace else, 
such as from another creature, a statue, 
from behind a door, down a passage, etc. 
The spellcaster can speak in any language 
that he knows, or make any sound that he 
can normally make. With respect to such 
voices and sounds, anyone rolling a success- 
ful saving throw vs. spell with a —2 penalty 
detects the ruse. If cast in conjunction with 
other illusions, the DM may rule greater 
penalties or disallow an independent saving 
throw against this spell in consideration of 
its contribution to the total effect of the 
combined illusion. 

The material component of this spell is a 
parchment rolled up into a small cone. 


Wall of Fog (Evocation) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ cube/level 
Saving Throw: None 


By casting this spell, the wizard creates a 
billowing wall of misty vapors in any area 
within the spell range. The wall of fog 
obscures all sight, normal and infravision, 
beyond two feet. The caster may create less 
vapor if he wishes. The wall must be a 
roughly cubic or rectangular mass, at least 
ten feet wide in its smallest dimension. The 
misty vapors persist for three or more 
rounds. Their duration can be halved by a 
moderate wind, and they can be blown 
away by a strong wind. 

The material component is a pinch of split 
dried peas. 


Wizard Mark (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Up to 1 square foot 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard is able 
to inscribe, visibly or invisibly, his personal 
rune or mark, as well as up to six additional 
characters of smaller size. A wizard mark 
spell enables the caster to etch the rune upon 
stone, metal, or any softer substance with- 
out harm to the material upon which the 
mark is placed. If an invisible mark is made, 
a detect magic spell will cause it to glow and 
be visible (though not necessarily under- 
standable). Detect invisibility, true seeing, a 
gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes will likewise 
expose an invisible wizard mark. A read 
magic spell will reveal the maker's words, if 
any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it 
can be removed by the caster or by an erase 
spell. If cast on a living being, normal wear 
gradually causes the mark to fade. 

The material components for this spell are 
a pinch of diamond dust (about 100 gp 
worth) and a pigment or pigments for the 
coloration of the mark. If the mark is to be 
invisible, the pigments are still used, but the 
caster uses a stylus of some sort rather than 
his finger. 


Second-Level Spells 


Alter Self (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 3d4 rounds + 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: The caster 

Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard can 
alter his appearance and form—including 
clothing and equipment—to appear taller or 
shorter; thin, fat, or in between; human, 
humanoid, or any other generally man- 
shaped bipedal creature. The caster’s body 
can undergo a limited physical alteration 
and his size can be changed up to 50%. If the 
form selected has wings, the wizard can 
actually fly, but at only 1/3 the speed of a 
true creature of that type, and with a loss of 
two maneuverability classes (to a minimum 
of E). If the form has gills, the caster can 
breathe underwater as long as the spell lasts. 
However, any multiple attack routines or 
additional damage allowed to an assumed 
form are not gained by the caster. 

The caster’s attack rolls, Armor Class, 
and saving throws do not change. The spell 
does not confer special abilities, attack 
forms, or defenses. Once the new form is 
chosen, it remains for the duration of the 
spell. The caster can change back into his 
own format will; this ends the spell immedi- 
ately. A caster who is slain automatically 
returns to his normal form. 


Bind (Enchantment) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is employed, the wizard 
can command any non-living ropelike 
object, including string, yarn, cord, line, 
rope, or even a cable. The spell affects 50 
feet of normal rope (one-inch diameter), 
plus five feet per caster level. This length is 
reduced by 50% for every additional inch of 
thickness and increases by 50% for each 1/2 
inch less. The possible commands are Coil 
(form a neat, coiled stack), Coil & Knot, 
Loop, Loop & Knot, Tie & Knot, and the 
reverses of all of the above (Uncoil, etc.). 
One command can be given each round. 

The rope can only enwrap a creature or 
an object within one foot of it—it does not 
snake outward—so it must be thrown or 
hurled near the intended target. Note that 
the rope itself, and any knots tied in it, are 
not magical. A typical rope might be AC 6 
and take 4 points of slashing damage before 
breaking. The rope does not inflict damage 


Wizard Spells (2nd Level) 


of any type, but it can be used as a trip line 
or to entangle a single opponent who fails a 
saving throw vs. spell. 


Blindness (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 30 yards + 10 yards/level 
Component: V 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


The blindness spell causes the victim to 
become blind, able to see only a grayness 
before its eyes. Various cure spells will not 
remove this effect, and only a dispel magic 
or the spellcaster can do away with the 
blindness if the creature fails its initial sav- 
ing throw vs. spell. A blinded creature suf- 
fers a —4 penalty to its attack rolls, and its 
opponents gain a +4 bonus to their attack 
rolls. 


Blur (Ilusion/Phantasm) 
Range: 0 


Components: V, S 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: The caster 

Saving Throw: None 


When a blur spell is cast, the wizard 
causes the outline of his form to become 
blurred, shifting and wavering. This distor- 
tion causes all missile and melee combat 
attacks against the caster to be made with 
—4 penalties on the first attempt and —2 
penalties on all successive attacks. It also 
grants the wizard a +1 bonus to his saving 
throw for any direct magical attack. A 
detect invisibility spell will not counter this 
effect, but the Sth-level clerical spell true 
seeing and similar magic will. 


Continual Light (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 60-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell is similar to a light spell, except 
that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts 
until negated by magical darkness or by a 
dispel magic spell. Creatures who suffer 
penalties in bright light suffer them in this 
spell’s area of effect. As with the light spell, 
it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or 
at a creature. In the third case, the spell af- 
fects the space about one foot behind a crea- 
ture that successfully rolls its saving throw 
vs. spell. Note that this spell can also blind a 
creature if it is successfully cast upon the 


the creature's attack rolls, saving throws, 
and Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on 
a small object that is then placed in a light- 
proof covering, the spell’s effects are 
blocked until the covering is removed. 

A continual light brought into an area of 
magical darkness (or vice versa) is tempo- 
rarily negated so that the otherwise prevail- 
ing light conditions exist in the overlapping 
areas of effect. A direct casting of continual 
light against a similar or weaker magical 
darkness cancels both. 

This spell eventually consumes the mate- 
rial it is cast upon, but the process takes far 
longer than the time in the typical cam- 
paign. Extremely hard and expensive mate- 
rials can last hundreds or even thousands of 
years. 


Darkness, 15’ Radius (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 15-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell causes total, impenetrable 
darkness in the area of effect. Infravision is 
useless. Neither normal nor magical light 
works unless a light or continual light spell 
is used. In the former event, the darkness 
spell is negated by the light spell and vice 
versa. 

The materia] components of this spell are 
a bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch ora 
piece of coal. 


Deafness (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The deafness spell causes the recipient to 
become totally deaf and unable to hear any 
sounds. The victim is allowed a saving 
throw vs. spell. An affected creature has a 
—1 penalty to its surprise rolls unless its 
other senses are unusually keen. Deafened 
spellcasters have a 20% chance to miscast 
any spell with a verbal component. This 
deafness can be done away with only by 
means of a dispel magic spell or by the spell- 
caster. 

The material component of this spell is 
beeswax. 


140 


Deeppockets (Alteration, Enchantment) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 12 hours + 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 1 garment 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the wizard to specially 
prepare a garment so as to hold far more 
than it normally could. A finely sewn gown 
or robe of high-quality material (at least 50 
gp value) is fashioned so as to contain 
numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is 
the minimum number. The deeppockets 
spell then enables these pockets to hold a 
total of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in vol- 
ume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. 
Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges 
where the special pockets are. At the time of 
casting, the caster can instead chose to have 
10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (3/2 
cubic foot volume each), If the robe or like 
garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets 
(200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be 
created to contain one pound of weight and 
1/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special 
pocket is actually an extradimensional hold- 
ing space. 

If the spell duration expires while there is 
material within the enchanted pockets, or if 
a successful dispel magic is cast upon the 
enchanted garment, all the material sudden- 
ly appears around the wearer and immedi- 
ately falls to the ground. The caster can also 
cause al] the pockets to empty with a single 
command. 

In addition to the garment, which is reus- 
able, the material components of this spell 
are a tiny golden needle and a strip of fine 
cloth given a half-twist and fastened at the 
ends. 


Detect Evil (Divination) 
Reversible 


Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 10-foot path 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell discovers emanations of evil (or 
of good in the case of the reverse spell) from 
any creature, object, or area. Character 
alignment is not revealed under most cir- 
cumstances: characters who are strongly 
aligned, do not stray from their faith, and 
who are at least 9th level might radiate good 
or evil if they are intent upon appropriate 
actions. Powerful monsters, such as ki-rin, 
send forth emanations of evil or good, even 
if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate 
evil, for it is this power and negative force 
that enable them to continue existing. An 


Wizard Spells (2nd Level) 


evilly cursed object or unholy water radi- 
ates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelli- 
gent viper does not. The degree of evil 
(faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming) 
can be noted. Note that priests have a more 
powerful version of this spell. 

The spell has a path of detection ten feet 
wide in the direction in which the mage is 
facing. The wizard must concentrate—stop, 
have quiet, and intently seek to detect the 
aura—for at least one round to receive a 
rea 


Detect Invisibility (Divination) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 10-foot path 
Saving Throw: None 


When the wizard casts a detect invisibility 
spell, he is able to see clearly any objects or 
beings that are invisible, as well as any that 
are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. In addi- 
tion, it enables the wizard to detect hidden 
or concealed creatures (e.g., thieves in 
shadows, halflings in underbrush, and so 
on). It does not reveal the method of con- 
cealment or invisibility, except in the case of 
astral travelers (where the silver cord can be 
seen). It does not reveal illusions or enable 
the caster to see through physical objects. 
Detection is in the wizard’s line of sight 
along a ten-foot-wide path to the range 
limit. 

The material components of this spell are 
a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of 
powdered silver. 


ESP (Divination) 


Range: 5 yards/level, 90 yards maximum 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 creature per probe 
Saving Throw: None 


When an ESP spell is used, the caster is 
able to detect the surface thoughts of any 
creatures in range—except for those of un- 
dead and creatures without minds (as we 
know them), The ESP is stopped by two or 
more feet of rock, two or more inches of any 
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead 
foil. The wizard employing the spell is able 
to probe the surface thoughts of one crea- 
ture per round, getting simple instinctual 
thoughts from lower order creatures. 
Probes can continue on the same creature 
from round to round or can move on to 
other creatures. The caster can use the spell 
to help determine if a creature lurks behind 
a door, for example, but the ESP does not al- 
ways reveal what sort of creature it is. If 
used as part of a program of interrogation, 


an intelligent and wary subject receives an 
initial saving throw. If successful, the crea- 
ture successfully resists and the spell reveals 
no additional information. If the saving 
throw is failed, the caster may learn addi- 
tional information, according to the DM's 
ruling. The creature's Wisdom adjustment 
applies, as may additional bonuses up to 
+4, based on the sensitivity of the informa- 
tion sought. 

The material component of this spell is a 
copper piece. 


Flaming Sphere (Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 3-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A flaming sphere spell creates a burning 
globe of fire within ten yards of the caster. 
This sphere rolls in whichever direction the 
wizard points, at a rate of 30 feet per round. 
It rolls over barriers less than four feet tall, 
such as furniture, low walls, etc. Flammable 
substances are set afire by contact with the 
sphere. Creatures in contact with the globe 
must successfully save vs. spell or suffer 2d4 
points of fire damage. Those within five feet 
of the sphere’s surface must also save or suf- 
fer 1d4 points of heat damage. A successful 
saving throw means no damage is suffered. 
The DM may adjust the saving throws if 
there is little or no room to dodge the 
sphere. 

The sphere moves as long as the spell- 
caster actively directs it, otherwise it merely 
stays at rest and burns. It can be extin- 
guished by the same means as any normal 
fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has 
a spongy, yielding consistency and so does 
not cause damage except by its flame. It can- 
not push unwilling creatures aside or batter 
down large obstacles. 

The material components are a bit of tal- 
low, a pinch of sulphur, and a dusting of 
powdered iron. 


Fog Cloud (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


The fog cloud spell can be cast in either 
one of two ways, at the caster’s option: asa 
large, stationary bank of normal fog, or asa 
harmless fog that resembles the 5th-level 
wizard spell, cloudkill. 

As a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of 
any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot 
cube per caster level. The fog obscures all 


141 


sight, normal and infravision, beyond two 
feet. : 

As a cloudkill-like fog, this is a billowing 
mass of ghastly, yellowish-green vapors, 
measuring 40' x 20’ x 20’. This moves away 
from the caster at ten feet per round. The 
vapors are heavier than air and sink to the 
lowest level, even pouring down sinkholes 
and den openings. Very thick vegetation 
breaks up the fog after it has moved 20 feet 
into the vegetation. 

The only effect of either version is to ob- 
scure vision. A strong breeze will disperse 
either effect in one round, while a moderate 
breeze will reduce the spell duration by 
50%. The spell cannot be cast underwater, 


Fools’ Gold (Alteration, Illusion) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 10 cu. in./level 
Saving Throw: Special 


Copper coins can temporarily be changed 
to gold pieces, or brass items turned to solid 
gold, for the spell duration by means of this 
magic. The area of effect is ten cubic inches 
per level—i.e., a 1" x 1" x 10” volume or 
equivalent, equal to about 150 gold coins. 
Any creature viewing the “gold” is entitled 
to a saving throw vs. spell, which can be 
modified by the creature's Wisdom; for ev- 
ery level of the wizard, the creature must 
subtract 1 from his dice roll. Thus it is un- 
likely that fools’ gold will be detected if it 
was created by a high-level caster. If the 
“gold” is struck hard by an object of cold- 
wrought iron, there is a slight chance it will 
revert to its natural state, depending on the 
material component used to create the 
“gold.” If a 25-gp citrine is powdered and 
sprinkled over the metal as this spell is cast, 
the chance that cold iron will return it to its 
true nature is 30%; if a 50-gp amber stone is 
powdered and used, there is a 25% chance 
that iron will dispel the magic; if a 250-gp 
topaz is powdered, the chance drops to 
10%; if a 500-gp oriental (corundum) topaz 
is powdered, there is only a 1% chance that 
the cold iron will reveal that it is fools’ gold. 


Wizard Spells (2nd Level) 


Forget (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell, the spellcaster 
causes creatures within the area of effect to 
forget the events of the previous round (the 
one minute of time previous to the utterance 
of the spell). For every three levels of experi- 
ence of the spellcaster, another minute of 
past time is forgotten. This does not negate 
charm, suggestion, geas, quest, or similar 
spells, but it is possible that the being who 
placed such magic upon the recipient could 
be forgotten. From one to four creatures can 
be affected, at the discretion of the caster. If 
only one is to be affected, the recipient saves 
vs. spell with a —2 penalty; if two, they 
save with —1 penalties; if three or four are 
to be affected, they save normally. All sav- 
ing throws are adjusted by Wisdom. A 
priest's heal or restoration spell, if specially 
cast for this purpose, will restore the lost 
memories, as will a limited wish or wish, 
but no other means will do so. 


Glitterdust (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell creates a cloud of glittering 
golden particles within the area of effect. 
Those in the area must roll a successful sav- 
ing throw vs. spell or be blinded (—4 penal- 
ties to attack rolls, saving throws, and 
Armor Class) for 1d4+1 rounds. In addi- 
tion, all within the area are covered by the 
dust, which cannot be removed and con- 
tinues to sparkle until it fades. Note that this 
reveals invisible creatures. The dust fades in 
1d4 rounds plus one round per caster level. 
Thus glitterdust cast by a 3rd-level wizard 
lasts for four to seven rounds. 

The material component is ground mica. 


Hypnotic Pattern (Ilusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Neg. 
When this spell is cast, the wizard creates 
a weaving, twisting pattern of subtle colors 


in the air. This pattern causes any creature 
looking at it to become fascinated and stand 


gazing at it as long as the spellcaster main- 
tains the display, plus two rounds there- 
after. The spell can captivate a maximum of 
24 levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures (e.g., 24 
creatures with 1 Hit Die each, 12 with 2 Hit 
Dice, etc). All creatures affected must be 
within the area of effect, and each is entitled 
to a saving throw vs. spell. A damage- 
inflicting attack on an affected creature frees 
it from the spell immediately. 

The mage need not utter a sound, but he 
must gesture appropriately while holding a 
glowing stick of incense or a crystal rod 
filled with phosphorescent material. 


improved Phantasmal Force 
(Iusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 200 sq. ft./ + 50.sq.ft./level 
Saving Throw: Special 


Like the 1st-level phantasmal force spell, 
this spell creates the illusion of any object, 
creature, or force, as long as it is within the 
spell’s area of effect. The spellcaster can 
maintain the illusion with minimal concen- 
tration, thus he can move at half normal 
speed (but not cast other spells). Some mi- 
nor sounds are included in the effects of the 
spell, but not understandable speech. Also, 
the improved phantasm continues for two 
rounds after the wizard ceases to concen- 
trate upon it. 

The material component is a bit of fleece. 


Invisibility (Ilusion/Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell causes the creature touched to 
vanish from sight and be undetectable by 
normal vision or even infravision. Of 
course, the invisible creature is not magi- 
cally silenced, and certain other conditions 
can render the creature detectable. Even al- 
lies cannot see the invisible creature or his 
gear, unless these allies can normally see in- 
visible things or employ magic to do so. 
Items dropped or put down by the invisible 
creature become visible, items picked up 
disappear if tucked into the clothing or 
pouches worn by the creature. Note, how- 
ever, that light never becomes invisible, al- 
though a source of light can become so (thus 
the effect is that of a light with no visible 
source). 

The spell remains in effect until it is magi- 
cally broken or dispelled, until the wizard 


142 


or recipient cancels it, until the recipient at- 
tacks any creature, or until 24 hours have 
passed. Thus the invisible being can open 
doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he 
attacks, he immediately becomes visible, al- 
though the invisibility enables him to attack 
first. Note that the clerical bless, chant, and 
prayer spells are not attacks for this pur- 
pose. All highly Intelligent (Int 13 or more) 
creatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels 
of experience have a chance to detect invisi- 
ble objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell; 
success means they noticed the invisible ob- 
ject). 

The material components of the invisibil- 
ity spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum ara- 
bic, the former encased in the latter. 


Irritation (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 to 4 creatures in a 15-foot- 
radius area 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


An irritation spell affects the epidermis of 
the subject creatures. Creatures with very 
thick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo, 
elephants, scaled creatures, etc.) are basi- 
cally unaffected by this. There are two ver- 
sions of the spell, either of which can be cast 
from the standard preparation: 

Itching. When cast, this causes each sub- 
ject to feel an instant itching sensation on . 
some portion of its body. If one round is not 
immediately spent scratching the irritated 
area, the creature is so affected that the next 
three rounds are spent squirming and twist- 
ing, effectively worsening its Armor Class by 
4 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time. 
Spel] preparations are ruined in the first 
round this spell is in effect, but not in the fol- 
lowing three rounds. Doing nothing but 
scratching the itch for a full round prevents 
the rest of the effect. If cast at one creature, 
the saving throw has a —3 penalty; if cast at 
two creatures, the saving throw has a —1 
penalty; and if cast at three or four creatures, 
the saving throw is normal. 

Rash. When a rash is cast, the subject no- 
tices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter 
its entire skin breaks out in red welts that 
itch. The rash persists until either a cure dis- 
ease or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It 
lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each 
of four days (i.e., maximum Charisma loss 
is 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is 
lowered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish 
immediately upon the removal of the rash, 
and all statistics return to normal. This can 
be cast at one creature only, with a saving 
throw penalty of —2. 

The material component for this spell is a 
leaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac. 


Wizard Spells (2nd Level) 


Knock (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 60 yards 

Component: V 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 10 square feet/level 
Saving Throw: None 


The knock spell opens stuck, barred, 
locked, held, or wizard-locked doors. It 
opens secret doors, as well as locked or 
trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loos- 
ens welds, shackles, or chains. If used to 
open a wizard-locked door, the spell does 
not remove the former spell, but simply sus- 
pends its functioning for one turn. In all 
other cases, it permanently opens locks or 
welds—although the former could be closed 
and locked again later. It does not raise 
barred gates or similar impediments (such as 
a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, 
and the like. Note that the effect is limited 
by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can knock a 
door of 30 square feet or less (e.g., a stand- 
ard 4’ x 7' door). Each spell can undo up to 
two means of preventing egress through a 
portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and 
held, or triple locked, opening it requires 
two knock spells. In all cases, the location of 
the door or item must be known—the spell 
cannot be used against a wall in hopes of 
discovering a secret door. 

The reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a 
door or similar closure, provided there is a 
physical mechanism. It does not create a 
weld, but it locks physically operated lock- 
ing mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to 
two functions. It cannot affect a portcullis. 


Know Alignment (Divination) 
Reversible 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 creature or object 
per 2 rounds 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


A know alignment spell enables the wiz- 
ard to read the aura of a creature or an 
aligned object (unaligned objects reveal 
nothing). The caster must remain stationary 
and concentrate on the subject for two full 
rounds. A creature is allowed a saving 
throw vs. spell and, if successful, the caster 
learns nothing about that particular crea- 
ture from the casting. If a creature or object 
is concentrated on for only one round, only 
its alignment with respect to law and chaos 
can be learned. Certain magical devices ne- 
gate the know alignment spell. 

The reverse, undetectable alignment, 
conceals the alignment of an object or crea- 


ture for 24 hours—even from a know align- 
ment spell. 


Leomund’’s Trap (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 3 rounds 

Area of Effect: Object touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This false trap is designed to fool a thief or 
other character attempting to pilfer the 
spellcaster's goods. The wizard places the 
spell upon any small mechanism or device, 
such as a lock, hinge, hasp, screw-on cap, 
ratchet, etc. Any character able to detect 
traps, or who uses any spell or device ena- 
bling trap detection, is 100% certain a real 
trap exists. Of course, the spell is illusory 
and nothing happens if the trap is sprung; its 
primary purpose is to frighten away thieves 
or make them waste precious time. 

The material component of the spell is a 
piece of iron pyrite touched to the object to 
be trapped while the object is sprinkled with 
a special dust requiring 200 gp to prepare. If 
another Leomund's trap is within 50 feet 
when the spell is cast, then the casting fails. 


Levitate (Alteration) 


Range: 20 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 creature or object 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


When a levitate spell is cast, the wizard 
can place it upon his person, upon an ob- 
ject, or upon a single creature, subject to a 
maximum weight limit of 100 pounds per 
level of experience (e.g., a 3rd-level wizard 
can levitate up to 300 pounds maximum). If 
the spell is cast upon the wizard, he can 
move vertically up or down at a movement 
rate of 2 per round. If cast upon an object or 
another creature, the wizard can levitate it 
at the same speed according to his com- 
mand. Horizontal movement is not empow- 
ered by this spell, but the recipient could 
push along the face of a cliff, for example, to 
move laterally. The spellcaster can cancel 
the spell as desired. If the subject of the spell 
is unwilling, or the object is in the posses- 
sion of a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is 
allowed to determine if the levitate spell af- 
fects it. 

Once cast, the spell requires no concen- 
tration, except when changing height. A 
levitating creature attempting to use a mis- 
sile weapon finds himself increasingly un- 
stable; the first attack has an attack roll 
penalty of —1, the second —2, and the third 
—3, etc., up to a maximum of —5. A full 
round spent stabilizing allows the creature 


143 


to begin again at —1. Lack of leverage 
makes it impossible to cock a medium or 
heavy crossbow. 

The material component of this spell is ei- 
ther a small leather loop or a piece of golden 
wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank 
on one end, 


Locate Object (Divination) 
Reversible 


Range: 20 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell aids in locating a known or fa- 
miliar object. The wizard casts the spell, 
slowly turns, and senses when he is facing in 
the direction of the object to be located, pro- 
vided the object is within range, i.e., 60 
yards for 3rd-level mages, 80 yards for 4th, 
100 yards for Sth, etc. The spell can locate 
such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, 
tools, weapons, or even a ladder or stair- 
way. Note that attempting to find a specific 
item such as jewelry or a crown, requires an 
accurate mental image; if the image is not 
close enough to the actual, the spell does not 
work, Desired but unique objects cannot be 
located by this spell unless they are known 
by the caster. The spell is blocked by lead. 
Creatures cannot be found by this spell. 

The material component is a forked twig. 

The reversal, obscure object, hides an ob- 
ject from location by spell, crystal ball, or 
similar means for eight hours. Creatures 
cannot be affected by this spell. The mate- 
rial component is a chameleon skin. 


Magic Mouth (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 object 
Saving Throw: None - 


Wher this spell is cast, the wizard imbues 
the chosen object with an enchanted mouth 
that suddenly appears and speaks his mes- 
sage when a specified event occurs. The 
message, which must be of 25 words or less, 
can be in any language known by the spell- 
caster, and can be delivered over a one-turn 
period. The mouth cannot speak magical 
spells or use command words. It does, how- 
ever, move to the words articulated—‘f it is 
placed upon a statue, the mouth of the 
statue would actually move and appear to 
speak, Of course, the magic mouth can be 
placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other 
object, excluding intelligent members of the 
animal or vegetable kingdoms. 


Wizard Spells (2nd Level) 


The spell functions when specific condi- 
tions are fulfilled, according to the com- 
mand of the spellcaster. Some examples are 
to speak “to the first creature that touches 
you,” or “to the first creature that passes 
within 30 feet.” Commands can be as general 
or as detailed as desired, although only vis- 
ual and audible triggers can be used, such as 
the following: “Speak only when a venera- 
ble female human carrying a sack of groat 
clusters sits crosslegged within one foot.” 
Such visual triggers can react to a character 
using the disguise ability. Command range 
is five yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th- 
level wizard can command the magic mouth 
to speak at a maximum encounter range of 
30 yards (“Speak when a winged creature 
comes within 30 yards.”). The spell lasts un- 
til the speak command can be fulfilled, thus 
the spell duration is variable. A magic 
mouth cannot distinguish invisible crea- 
tures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, 
except by external garb. If desired, the effect 
can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken 
word. 

The material component of this spell is a 
small bit of honeycomb. 


Melf’s Acid Arrow (Conjuration) 


Range: 180 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 target 
Saving Throw: Special 


By means of this spell, the wizard creates 
a magical arrow that speeds to its target as if 
fired from the bow of a fighter of the same 
level as the wizard. No modifiers for range, 
non-proficiency, or specialization are used. 
The arrow has no attack or damage bonus, 
but it inflicts 2d4 points of acid damage 
(with saving throws for items on the target). 
(There is no splash damage.) For every three 
levels that the caster has achieved, the acid 
lasts for another round, unless somehow 
neutralized, inflicting another 2d4 points of 
damage each round. So at 3rd-Sth level, the 
acid lasts two rounds, at 6th-8th level, the 
acid lasts for three rounds, etc. 

The material components of the spell are 
a dart, powdered rhubarb leaf, and an ad- 
der’s stomach. 


Mirror Image (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 
Duration: 3 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 6-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


When a mirror image spell is invoked, the 
spellcaster causes from two to eight exact 
duplicates of himself to come into being 
around him. These images do exactly what 
the wizard does. Since the spell causes a 
blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, 
it is impossible for opponents to be certain 
which are the illusions and which is the ac- 
tual wizard. When an image is struck by a 
melee or missile attack, magical or other- 
wise, it disappears, but any other existing 
images remain intact until struck. The im- 
ages seem to shift from round to round, so 
that if the actual wizard is struck during one 
round, he cannot be picked out from among 
his images the next. To determine the num- 
ber of images that appear, roll 1d4 and add 1 
for every three levels of experience the wiz- 
ard has achieved, to a maximum of eight im- 
ages. At the end of the spell duration, all 
surviving images wink out. 


Misdirection (Iusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 8 hours 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 creature or object 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell, the wizard misdi- 
rects the information from a detection spell 
(detect charm, detect evil, detect invisibil- 
ity, detect lie, detect magic, detect snares 
and pits, etc.). While the detection spell 
functions, it indicates the wrong area, crea- 
ture, or the opposite of the truth with re- 
spect to detect evil or detect lie. The wizard 
directs the spell effect upon the object of the 
detection spell. If the caster of the detection 
spell fails his saving throw vs. spell, the mis- 
direction takes place. Note that this spell 
does not affect other types of divination 
(know alignment, augury, ESP, clairvoy- 
ance, etc.). 


Protection From Cantrips (Abjuration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 5 hours + 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Creature or object touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By casting this spell, the wizard receives 
immunity to the effects of cantrips cast by 
other wizards, apprentices, or creatures that 


144 


use the cantrip spell. The spell protects the 
caster, or one item or person that he touches 
(such as a spel] book or a drawer containing 
spell components). Any cantrip cast against 
the protected person or item dissipates with 
an audible popping sound. This spell is of- 
ten used by a wizard who has mischievous 
apprentices, or one who wishes apprentices 
to clean or shine an area using elbow grease 
rather than magic. Any unwilling target of 
this spell must be touched (via an attack 
roll) and is allowed a saving throw vs. spell 
to escape the effect. 


Pyrotechnics (Alteration) 


Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 fire source (special) 
Saving Throw: None 


A pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing 
fire source to produce either of two effects, 
at the option of the caster. First, it can pro- 
duce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, 
colored aerial fireworks that lasts one 
round. This effect temporarily blinds those 
creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the 
area and that have an unobstructed line of 
sight to the burst. Creatures viewing this are 
blinded for 1d4 + 1 rounds unless they suc- 
cessfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a 
volume ten times greater than that of the 
original fire source. 

This spell can also cause a thick, writhing 
stream of smoke to arise from the source 
and form a choking cloud that lasts for one 
round per experience level of the caster, This 
covers a roughly spherical volume from the 
ground or floor up (or conforming to the 
shape of a confined area) that totally ob- 
scures vision beyond two feet. The smoke 
fills a volume 100 times that of the fire 
source. All within the cloud must roll suc- 
cessful saving throws vs. spell or suffer —2 
penalties to all combat rolls and Armor 
Class. 

The spell uses one fire source within a 20- 
foot cube, which is immediately extin- 
guished. An extremely large fire used as a 
source might be only partially extinguished. 
Magical fires are not extinguished, although 
a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemen- 
tal) used as a source suffers 1 point of dam- 
age per caster level. 


Wizard Spells (2nd Level) 


Ray of Enfeeblement 
(Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 10 yards + 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of a ray of enfeeblement, a wiz- 
ard weakens an opponent, reducing its 
Strength and thereby the attacks that rely 
upon it. Humans, demihumans, and hu- 
manoids of man-size or less are reduced to 
an effective Strength of 5, losing all Strength 
bonuses and suffering an attack roll penalty 
of —2 and a —1 penalty to damage. Other 
creatures suffer a penalty of —2 on attack 
rolls. Furthermore, they have a 
—1 penalty for each die of damage they in- 
flict. (But no damage roll can inflict less 
than 1 point per die of damage.) Your DM 
will determine any other effects appropriate 
to the affected creature. If the target crea- 
ture makes its saving throw, the spell has no 
effect. This spell does not affect combat bo- 
nuses due to magical items, and those con- 
ferring increased Strength function 
normally. 


Rope Trick (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 2 turns/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast upon a piece of 
rope from five to 30 feet long, one end of the 
rope rises into the air until the whole hangs 
perpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end. 
The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an ex- 
tradimensional space. The spellcaster and 
up to seven others can climb up the rope and 
disappear into this place of safety where no 
creature can find them. The rope can be 
taken into the extradimensional space if 
fewer than eight persons have climbed it, 
otherwise it simply stays hanging in the air 
(extremely strong creatures might be able to 
remove it, at the DM's option). Spells can- 
not be cast across the interdimensional in- 
terface, nor can area effects cross it. Those 
in the extradimensional space can see out of 
it as if there is a 3’ x 5‘ window centered on 
the rope. The persons in the extradimen- 
sional space must climb down prior to the 
end of the spell, or they are dropped from 
the height at which they entered the extradi- 
mensional space. The rope can be climbed 
by only one person at a time. Note that the 
rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a 
normal place if they do not climb all the way 
to the extradimensional space. Also note 


that creating or taking extradimensional 
spaces into an existing extradimensional 
space is hazardous. 

The material components of this spell are 
powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of 
parchment. 


Scare (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 30 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 15-foot radius 

Saving Throw: Special 


This spell causes creatures with fewer 
than 6 Hit Dice or levels of experience to fall 
into fits of trembling and shaking. The 
frightened creatures have a —2 reaction ad- 
justment and may drop items held if encum- 
bered. If cornered, they fight, but with —1 
penalties to attack and damage rolls, and to 
saving throws as well. 

Only elves, half-elves, and priests are al- 
lowed saving throws against this spell. Note 
that this spell has no effect on the undead 
(skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and so on), or 
on upper or lower planar creatures of any 
sort. 

The material component used for this 
spell is a bit of bone from an undead skele- 
ton, zombie, ghoul, ghast, or mummy. 


Shatter (Alteration) 


Range: 30 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Instantaneous 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 3-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The shatter spell is a sound-based attack 
that affects nonmagical objects of crystal, 
glass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, 
bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, etc. 
All such objects within a three-foot radius 
of the center of the spell effect are smashed 
into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects 
weighing more than one pound per level of 
the caster are not affected, but all other ob- 
jects of the appropriate composition must 
save vs. crushing blow or be shattered. Al- 
ternatively, the spell can be focused against 
a single item of up to 10 pounds per caster 
level. Crystalline creatures usually suffer 
1d6 points of damage per caster level to a 
maximum of 6d6, with a saving throw vs. 
spell for half damage. 

The material component of this spell is a 
chip of mica.

Spectral Hand (Necromancy) 


Range: 30 yards + 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 opponent 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell causes a ghostly, glowing hand, 
shaped from the caster’s life force, to materi- 
alize within the spell range and move as the 
caster desires. Any touch attack spell of 4th 
level or less that is subsequently cast by the 
wizard can be delivered by the spectral 
hand. The spell gives the caster a +2 bonus 
to his attack roll. The caster cannot perform 
any other actions when attacking with the 
hand; the hand returns to the caster and 
hovers if the caster takes other actions. The 
hand lasts the full spell duration unless dis- 
missed by the caster, and it is possible to use 
more than one touch attack with it. The 
hand receives flank and rear attack bonuses 
if the caster is in a position to do so. The 
hand is vulnerable to magical attack (but it 
has an Armor Class of —2). Any damage to 
the hand ends the spell and inflicts 1d4 
points of damage to the caster. 


Stinking Cloud (Evocation) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time:2 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


When a stinking cloud is cast, the wizard 
creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors 
up to 30 yards away from his position. Any 
creature caught within the cloud must roll a 
successful saving throw vs. poison or be 
reeling and unable to attack because of nau- 
sea, for 1d4 + 1 rounds after leaving the 
cloud. Those who make successful saving 
throws can leave the cloud without suffer- 
ing any ill effects, although those remaining 
in the cloud must continue to save each 
round. These poisonous effects can be 
slowed or neutralized by appropriate 
magic. The cloud duration is halved in a 
moderate breeze (8-18 m.p.h) and is dis- 
persed in one round by a stronger breeze. 

The material component of the spell is a 
rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves. 


Wizard Spells (2nd Level) 


Strength (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Person touched 
Saving Throw: None 


Application of this spell increases the 
Strength of the character by a number of 
points—or tenths of points after 18 Strength 
is attained (only if the character is a war- 
rior). Benefits of the strength spell last for 
the duration of the magic. The amount of 
added Strength depends upon the spell re- 
cipient's group and is subject to all restric- 
tions on Strength due to race and class. 
Multi-class characters use the best die. 


Class Strength Gain 
Priest 1dé6 points 
Rogue 1d6 points 
Warrior 1d8 points 
Wizard 1d4 points 


If a warrior has an 18 Strength already, 
from 10% to 80% is added to his extraordi- 
nary Strength roll. The spell cannot confer a 
Strength of 19 or more, nor is it cumulative 
with other magic that adds to Strength. Be- 
ings without Strength scores (kobolds, liz- 
ard men, etc.) receive a +1 to attack and 
damage rolls. 

The material component of this spell is a 
few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a partic- 
ularly strong animal—ape, bear, ox, etc. 


Summon Swarm 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 10-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The swarm of small animals (roll on fol- 
lowing table to determine type, or the DM 
can assign an appropriate creature) drawn 
by the summon swarm spell will viciously 
attack all creatures in the area chosen by the 
caster. Creatures actively defending against 
the swarm to the exclusion of other activi- 
ties suffer 1 point of damage for each round 
spent in the swarm. Those taking other 
actions, including leaving the swarm, re- 
ceive damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point 
per three levels of the caster, every round. 
Note that spellcasting within the swarm is 
impossible, 


Dice Roll Swarm Type 
01-40 Rats 
41-70 Bats 
71-80 Spiders 
81-90 Centipedes/beetles 
91-100 Flying insects 


The swarm cannot be fought effectively 
with weapons, but fire and area effects can 
force it to disperse by inflicting damage. 
The swarm disperses when it has taken a to- 
tal of 2 hit points per caster level from these 
attacks. A protection from evil spell keeps 
the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect 
spells, such as gust of wind and stinking 
cloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if ap- 
propriate to the swarm summoned (e.g., 
only flyers are affected by a gust of wind). 
The caster must remain stationary and un- 
disturbed to control the swarm; if his con- 
centration lapses or is broken, the swarm 
disperses in two rounds. The swarm is sta- 
tionary once conjured. 

The material component is a square of red 
cloth. 


Tasha’s Uncontrollable Hideous 
Laughter (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 
30-foot cube 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


The victim of this spell perceives every- 
thing as hilariously funny. The effect is not 
immediate, and the creature feels only a 
slight tingling on the round the spell is cast. 
On the round immediately following, the 
victim begins smiling, then giggling, chuck- 
ling, tittering, snickering, guffawing, and fi- 
nally collapsing into gales of 
uncontrollable, hideous laughter. Although 
this magical mirth lasts only a single round, 
the affected creature must spend the next 
round regaining its feet, and it loses 2 points 
from its Strength (or —2 to attack and dam- 
age rolls) for all remaining rounds of the 
spell, 

The saving throw vs. spell is modified by 
the Intelligence of the creature. Creatures 
with Intelligences of 4 or less (semi- 
intelligent) are totally unaffected. Those 
with Intelligences of 5-7 (low) save with —6 
penalties. Those with Intelligences of 8-12 
(average to very) save with —4 penalties. 
Those with Intelligences of 13-14 (high) save 
with —2 penalties. Those with Intelligences 
of 15 or greater (exceptional) have unmodi- 
fied saving throws. 

The caster can affect one creature for ev- 
ery three levels attained—e.g., one at 3rd 
level, two at 6th level, three at 9th level, etc. 
All affected beings must be within 30 feet of 
each other. 

The material components are a small 
feather and minute tarts. The tarts are 
hurled at the subjects, while the feather is 
waved in one hand. 


146 


Web (Evocation) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 2 turns/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. or 4/2 


A web spell creates a many-layered mass 
of strong, sticky strands similar to spider 
webs but far larger and tougher. These 
masses must be anchored to two or more 
solid and diametrically opposed points— 
floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the 
web collapses upon itself and disappears. 

The web spell covers a maximum area of 
eight 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cubes and the webs must 
be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet 
high, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be 
cast. Creatures caught within webs, or sim- 
ply touching them, become stuck among the 
gluey fibers. 

Anyone in the area when the spell is cast 
must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a —2 
penalty. If the saving throw is successful, 
two things may have occurred. If the crea- 
ture has room to escape the area, then it is 
assumed to have jumped free. If there is no 
room to escape, then the webs are only half 
strength. Creatures with less than 13 
Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are 
stuck until freed by another or until the spell 
wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective 
against creatures trapped in webs. 

Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 
17 can break through one foot of webs per 
round. Creatures with 18 or greater 
Strength can break through two feet of webs 
per round, If the webs are at half strength, 
these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates 
to great strength in this case, and creatures 
of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong 
and huge creatures can break through 10 
feet of webs per round. 

Furthermore, the strands of a web spell 
are flammable. A magical flaming sword 
can slash them away as easily as a hand 
brushes away cobwebs. Any fire—torch, 
flaming oil, flaming sword, etc.—can set 
them alight and burn them away in a single 
round. All creatures within flaming webs 
suffer 2d4 points of damage from the 
flames, but those free of the strands are not 
harmed, 

The material component of this spell is a 
bit of spider web. 


Wizard Spells (3rd Level) 


Whispering Wind 
(Alteration, Phantasm) 


Range: 1 mile/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 2-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard is able 
to either send a message or cause some de- 
sired sound effect. The whispering wind can 
travel as many miles above ground as the 
spellcaster has levels of experience, to a spe- 
cific location within range that is familiar to 
the wizard. The whispering wind is as gentle 
and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches 
the location. It then delivers its whisper- 
quiet message or other sound. Note that the 
message is delivered regardless of whether 
anyone is present to hear it. The wind then 
dissipates. The wizard can prepare the spell 
to bear a message of up to 25 words, cause 
the spell to deliver other sounds for one 
round, or merely have the whispering wind 
seem to be a faint stirring of the air that has 
a susurrant sound. He can likewise cause the 
whispering wind to move as slowly as a mile 
per hour or as quickly as a mile every turn. 
When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls 
and remains until the message is delivered. 
As with the magic mouth spell, no spells 
may be cast via the whispering wind. 


Wizard Lock (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 30 square feet/level 
Saving Throw: None 


A wizard lock spell cast upon a door, 
chest, or portal magically locks it. The 
caster can freely pass his own lock without 
affecting it; otherwise, the wizard-locked 
door or object can be opened only by break- 
ing in, a successful dispel magic, or knock 
spell, or by a wizard four or more levels 
higher than the one casting the spell. Note 
that the last two methods do not remove the 
wizard lock, they only negate it for a brief 
duration, about one turn. Creatures from 
other planes cannot burst a wizard lock as 
they can a held portal (see the hold portal 
spell). 


Third-Level Spells 


Blink (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard causes 
his material form to “blink” directly from 
one point to another at a random time and 
in a random direction. This means that me- 
lee attacks against the wizard automatically 
miss if initiative indicates they fall after he 
has blinked. 

Each round the spell is in effect, the wiz- 
ard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the 
blink—the result of the dice roll is used as 
the wizard’s initiative for that round. The 
wizard disappears and instantaneously re- 
appears 10 feet distant from his previous po- 
sition. (Direction is determined by roll of 
1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right 
behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = 
left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster 
cannot blink into a solid object; if such is in- 
dicated, reroll the direction. Movable ob- 
jects of size and mass comparable to the 
caster are shoved aside when the caster 
blinks in. If blinking is impossible except 
into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then 
trapped on the Ethereal plane. 

During each round that he blinks, the 
spellcaster can be attacked only by oppo- 
nents who win initiative or by those who are 
able to strike both locations at once (e.g., 
with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar 
wide-area attack forms). Opponents with 
multiple attacks, or those operating under 
haste or similar effects, can often strike 
early enough to have at least one attack 
against the caster. 


147 


If the spelicaster holds off his attack (if 
any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until 
the blink is added to his normal 1d 10 initia- 
tive roll (thus he probably attacks last in the 
round). Or the spellcaster can try to get his 
attack in before he blinks (he must an- 
nounce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for 
blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In 
this case, the caster compares the two dice 
rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower 
than his blink roll (the two rolls are not 
added if he is trying to attack before he 
blinks). If so, he attacks according to his ini- 
tiative roll, then blinks according to the 
blink roll. If his blink roll is lower than his 
initiative roll, however, he blinks out, then 
he attacks in whatever direction he’s facing 
(he must go through with his attack, even if 
he is facing in the wrong direction to affect 
anyone). 


Clairaudience (Divination) 


Range: Special 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The clairaudience spell enables the wizard 
to concentrate upon some locale and hear in 
his mind any noise within a 60-foot radius 
of the spell's casting point. Distance is not a 
factor, but the locale must be known—a 
place familiar to the spellcaster or an obvi- 
ous one (such as behind a door, around a 
corner, in a copse of trees, etc.). Only 
sounds that are normally detectable by the 
wizard can be heard by use of this spell, 
Lead sheeting or magical protections pre- 
vent the operation of the spell, and the wiz- 
ard has some indication that the spell is so 
blocked. Note that it functions only on the 
wizard’s current plane of existence. The 
spell creates an invisible sensor that can be 
magically dispelled. 

The material component of the spell is a 
small horn of at least 100 gp value. 


Clairvoyance (Divination) 


Range: Special 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


Similar to the clairaudience spell, the 
clairvoyance spell empowers the wizard to 
see in his mind whatever is within sight 
range from the spell locale chosen. Distance 
from the wizard is not a factor, but the lo- 
cale must be known—familiar or obvious. 
Furthermore, light is a factor, as the spell 
does not enable the use of infravision or 


Wizard Spells (3rd Level) 


magical enhancements. If the area is magi- 
cally dark, only darkness is seen; if natu- 
rally pitch dark, only a 10-foot radius from 
the center of the spell’s area of effect can be 
seen. Otherwise, the seeing extends to the 
normal vision range according to the pre- 
vailing light. Lead sheeting or magical pro- 
tection foils a clairvoyance spell, and the 
wizard has some indication that it is so 
blocked. The spell creates an invisible sen- 
sor, similar to that created by a crystal ball 
spell, that can be dispelled. The spell func- 
tions only on the wizard’s current plane of 
existence. 

The material component is a pinch of 
powdered pineal gland. 


Delude (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of a delude spell, the wizard 
conceals his own alignment with that of any 
creature within a 30-foot radius at the time 
the spell is cast. The creature must be of 
higher than animal intelligence for the spell 
to work; its own alignment remains un- 
changed. The creature receives a saving 
throw vs. spell and, if successful, the delude 
spell fails. If the spell is successful, any 
know alignment spell used against the caster 
discovers only the assumed alignment. Note 
that a detect good or detect evil also detects 
the assumed aura, if the aura is strong 
enough. The creature whose aura has been 
assumed radiates magic, but the wizard ra- 
diates magic only to the creature whose 
alignment has been assumed, If a delude 
spell is used in conjunction with a change 
self or alter self spell, the class of the wizard 
can be totally hidden, if he is clever enough 
to carry off the disguise. 


Dispel Magic (Abjuration) 


Range: 120 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube 
Saving Throw: None 


When a wizard casts this spell, it has a 
chance to neutralize or negate magic it 
comes in contact with, as follows: 

First, it removes spells and spell-like ef- 
fects (including device effects and innate 
abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, 
it disrupts the casting or use of these in the 
area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. 
Third, it destroys magical potions (which 
are treated as 12th level for purposes of this 
spell). 


Each effect or potion in the spell’s area is 
checked to determine if it is dispelled. The 
caster can always dispel his own magic; oth- 
erwise the chance to dispel depends on the 
difference in level between the magical ef- 
fect and the caster. The base chance is 50% 
(11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster 
is higher level than the creator of the effect 
to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted 
from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel 
(thus making it more likely that the dispel 
succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, then 
the difference is added to the number 
needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less 
likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 
always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. 
Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a 
roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dis- 
pelled. 

A dispel magic spell does not affect a spe- 
cially enchanted item, such as a magical 
scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous 
item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is 
cast directly upon the item. This renders the 
item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An 
item possessed and carried by a creature 
gains the creature's saving throw against 
this effect, otherwise it is automatically ren- 
dered nonoperational. An interdimensional 
interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered 
nonoperational would be temporarily 
closed. Note that an item’s physical proper- 
ties are unchanged: a nonoperational magi- 
cal sword is still a sword. 

Artifacts and relics are not subject to this 
spell; however, some of their spell-like ef- 
fects may be, at the DM's option. 

Note that this spell can be very effective 
when used upon charmed and similarly be- 
guiled creatures. Certain spells or effects 
cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the 
spell descriptions. 


Explosive Runes (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None or 1/2 


By tracing these mystic runes upon a 
book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing 
written information, the wizard prevents 
unauthorized persons from reading his ma- 
terial. The explosive runes are difficult to 
detect—5% chance per level of magic use 
experience of the reader; thieves have only a 
5% chance. But trap detection by spell or 
magical device always finds these runes. 

When read, the explosive runes detonate, 
delivering 6d4 + 6 points of damage to the 
reader, who gets no saving throw, A like 
amount, or half that if saving throws are 
made, is suffered by each creature within 
the blast radius. The wizard who cast the 
spell, as well as any he instructs, can read 
the protected writing without triggering the 
runes. Likewise, the wizard can remove the 
runes whenever desired. Others can remove 
them only with a successful dispel magic or 
erase spell. Explosive runes otherwise last 
until the spell is triggered. The item upon 
which the runes are placed is destroyed 
when the explosion takes place, unless it is 
not normally subject to destruction by mag- 
ical fire (see the Item Saving Throws in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide).

Wizard Spells (3rd Level) 


Feign Death (Necromancy) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster (or any 
other creature whose levels of experience or 
Hit Dice do not exceed the wizard’s own 
level) can be put into a cataleptic state that is 
impossible to distinguish from death. 
Although the person or creature affected by 
the feign death spell can smell, hear, and 
know what is going on, no feeling or sight of 
any sort is possible. Thus any wounding or 
mistreatment of the body is not felt and no 
reaction occurs; damage is only 1/2 normal. 
In addition, paralysis, poison, or energy- 
level drain cannot affect an individual under 
the influence of this spell. Poison injected or 
otherwise introduced into the body takes 
effect when the spell recipient is no longer 
under the influence of this spell, although a 
saving throw is permitted. 

Note that only a willing individual can be 
affected by feign death. The spellcaster can 
end the spell effects at any time desired, as 
will a successful dispel, but a full round is 
required for bodily functions to begin again. 


Fireball (Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Instantaneous 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 20-foot radius 
Saving Throw: 1/2 


A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, 
which detonates with a low roar and deliv- 
ers damage proportional to the level of the 
wizard who cast it—1d6 points of damage 
for each level of experience of the spellcaster 
(up to a maximum of 10d6). The burst of the 
fireball creates little pressure and generally 
conforms to the shape of the area in which it 
occurs. The fireball fills an area equal to its 
normal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 
cubic feet—thirty-three 10' x 10’ x 10’ 
cubes). Besides causing damage to crea- 
tures, the fireball ignites all combustible 
materials within its burst radius, and the 
heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as 
gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items 
require saving throws vs. magical fire to 
determine if they are affected, but items in 
the possession of a creature that rolls a suc- 
cessful saving throw are unaffected by the 
fireball. 

The wizard points his finger and speaks 
the range (distance and height) at which the 
fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the 
pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a 
material body or solid barrier prior to 


attaining the prescribed range, blossoms 
into the fireball (an early impact results in 
an early detonation). Creatures failing their 
saving throws each suffer full damage from 
the blast. Those who roll successful saving 
throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll 
aside, each receiving half damage (the DM 
rolls the damage and each affected creature 
suffers either full damage or half damage 
[round fractions down], depending on 
whether the creature saved or not). 

The material component of this spell is a 
tiny ball of bat guano and sulphur. 


Flame Arrow (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 30 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell has two effects. First, the wiz- 
ard can cause normal arrows or crossbow 
bolts to become magical flaming missiles for 
one round, The missiles must be nocked and 
drawn (or cocked) at the completion of the 
spell. If they are not loosed within one 
round, they are consumed by the magic. For 
every five levels the caster has achieved, up 
to 10 arrows or bolts can be affected. The 
arrows inflict normal damage, plus 1 point 
of fire damage to any target struck. They 
may also cause incendiary damage. This 
version of the spell is used most often in 
large battles. 

The second version of this spell enables 
the caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents 
within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of 
piercing damage, plus 4d6 points of fire 
damage. Only half of the fire damage is 
inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. 
spell. The caster receives one bolt for every 
five experience levels (two bolts at 10th 
level, three at 15th level, etc.). Bolts must be 
used on creatures within 20 yards of each 
other and in front of the wizard. 

The material components for this spell are 
a drop of oil and a small piece of flint. 


Fly (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level + 1d6 turns 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the wizard to bestow 
the power of magical flight. The creature 
affected is able to move vertically and hor- 
izontally at a rate of 18 (half that if ascend- 
ing, twice that if descending in a dive). The 
maneuverability class of the creature is B. 
Using the fly spell requires as much concen- 
tration as walking, so most spells can be cast 


149 


while hovering or moving slowly (move- 
ment of 3). Possible combat penalties while 
flying are known to the DM (in the “Aerial 
Combat” section of the DMG). The exact 
duration of the spell is always unknown to 
the spellcaster, as the variable addition is 
determined secretly by the DM. 

The material component of the fly spell is 
a wing feather of any bird. 


Gust of Wind (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S$, M 

Duration: 1 round 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 10-foot wide path, 10 
yards/level long 

Saving Throw: None 


Wher this spell is cast, a strong puff of air 
originates from the wizard and moves in the 
direction he is facing. The force of this gust 
of wind (about 30 m.p.h) is sufficient to 
extinguish candles, torches, and similar 
unprotected flames. It causes protected 
flames—such as those of lanterns—to dance 
wildly and has a 5% chance per level of 
experience of the spellcaster to extinguish 
even such lights. It also fans large fires out- 
ward 1dé6 feet in the direction of the wind’s 
movement. It forces back small flying crea- 
tures 1d6 X 10 yards and causes man-sized 
beings to be held motionless if attempting to 
move against its force. It slows larger-than- 
man-sized flying creatures by 50% for one 
round. It blows over light objects, disperses 
most vapors, and forces away gaseous or 
unsecured levitating creatures. Its path is 10 
feet wide by 10 yards long per level of expe- 
rience of the caster (e.g., an 8th-level wizard 
causes a gust of wind that travels 80 yards). 

The material component of the spell is a 
legume seed. 


Haste (Alteration) 


Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 40’ cube, 1 creature/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, each affected crea- 
ture functions at double its normal move- 
ment and attack rates. A hasted creature 
gains a —2 initiative bonus. Thus, a crea- 
ture moving at 6 and attacking once per 
round would move at 12 and attack twice 
per round. Spellcasting and spell effects are 
not sped up. The number of creatures that 
can be affected is equal to the casters experi- 
ence level; those creatures closest to the cen- 
ter of effect are affected first. All affected by 
haste must be in the designated area of 
effect. Note that this spell negates the effects 
of a slow spell. Additionally, this spell ages 


Wizard Spells (3rd Level) 


the recipient by one year, because of sped- 
up metabolic processes. This spell is not cu- 
mulative with itself or with other similar 
magic. 

Its material component is a shaving of lic- 
orice root. 


Hold Person (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 1 to 4 persons in a 
20-foot cube 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihu- 
mans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immo- 
bile for five or more rounds. 

The hold person spell affects any bipedal 
human, demihuman or humanoid of man- 
size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, 
dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, 
half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, 
humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, 
pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. 

The spell is centered on a point selected 
by the caster; it affects persons selected by 
the caster within the area of effect. If the 
spell is cast at three or four people, each gets 
an unmodified saving throw. If only two 
people are being enspelled, each makes his 
saving throw with a —1 penalty. If the spell 
is cast at only one person, the saving throw 
suffers a ~3 penalty. Saving throws are ad- 
justed for Wisdom. Those succeeding on 
their saving throws are unaffected by the 
spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. 

Held beings cannot move or speak, but 
they remain aware of events around them 
and can use abilities not requiring motion or 
speech. Being held does not prevent the 
worsening of the subjects’ condition due to 
wounds, disease, or poison. The caster can 
end the spell with a single utterance at any 
time; otherwise the duration is 10 rounds at 
Sth level, 12 rounds at 6th level, 14 rounds 
at 7th level, etc. 

The spellcaster needs a small, straight 
piece of iron as the material component of 
this spell. 


Hold Undead (Necromancy) 


Range: 60’ 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1d4 rounds +1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1d3 undead 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


When cast, this spell renders immobile 
1d3 undead creatures whose total Hit Dice 
are equal to or less than the caster’s level. No 
more than three undead can be affected by a 
single spell. To cast, the wizard aims the 
spell at a point within range and the three 


undead closest to this are considered to be in 
the area of effect, provided all are within the 
field of vision and spell range of the caster. 
Undead of a mindless nature (skeletons, 
zombies, or ghouls) are automatically af- 
fected. Other forms of undead are allowed a 
saving throw to negate the effect. If the spell 
is successful, it renders the undead immobile 
for the duration of the spell. 

The material component for this spell is a 
pinch of sulphur and powdered garlic. 


Illusionary Script (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 day/level 

Casting Time: Special 

Area of Effect: Creature reading the script 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell enables the wizard to write in- 
structions or other information on parch- 
ment, paper, etc. The illusionary script 
appears to be some form of foreign or magi- 
cal writing. Only the person (or people) 
who the wizard desires to read the writing 
can do so. An illusionist recognizes it for il- 
lusionary script. 

Unauthorized creatures glancing at the 
script must roll saving throws vs. spell. A 
successful save means the creature can look 
away with only a mild sense of disorienta- 
tion. Failure means the creature is subject to 
a suggestion implanted in the script by the 
caster at the time the illusionary script was 
cast. The suggestion cannot require more 
than three turns to carry out. The sugges- 
tion could be to close the book and leave, or 
to forget the existence of the book, for ex- 
ample. A successful dispel magic spell will 
remove the illusionary script, but an unsuc- 
cessful attempt erases all of the writing. The 
hidden writings can be read by a combina- 
tion of the true seeing spell and either the 
read magic or comprehend languages spell, 
as applicable. 

The material component is a lead-based 
ink that requires special manufacture by an 
alchemist, at a cost of not less than 300 gp 
per usage. 


Infravision (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 hours + 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard enables 
the recipient to see in normal darkness up to 
60 feet without light. Note that strong 
sources of light (fire, lanterns, torches, etc.) 
tend to blind this vision, so infravision does 
not function efficiently in the presence of 
such light sources. Invisible creatures are 


150 


not detectable by infravision. 
The material component of this spell is ei- 
ther a pinch of dried carrot or an agate. 


Invisibility, 10’ Radius 
(Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius of 
creature touched 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell confers invisibility upon all 
creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. 
Gear carried and light sources are included, 
but any light emitted is still visible. The cen- 
ter of the effect is mobile with the recipient. 
Those affected by this spell cannot see each 
other. Any affected creature moving out of 
the area becomes visible, but creatures mov- 
ing into the area after the spell is cast do not 
become invisible. Affected creatures (other 
than the recipient) that attack negate the in- 
visibility only for themselves. If the spell re- 
cipient attacks, the invisibility, 10' radius 
spell is broken for all. 

The material components are the same as 
for the invisibility spell. 


Item (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 4 hours/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 2 cu. ft./level 
Saving Throw: Special 


By means of this spell, the wizard is able 
to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within 
the size limit) to 1/12 of its normal size. Op- 
tionally, the caster can also change its now- 
shrunken composition to a cloth-like one. 
An object in the possession of another crea- 
ture is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Ob- 
jects changed by an item spell can be 
returned to normal composition and size 
merely by tossing them onto any solid sur- 
face or by a word of command from the 
original spellcaster. Note that even a burn- 
ing fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this 
spell.

Leomund’s Tiny Hut (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 4 hours + 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 15-foot-diameter sphere 
Saving Throw: None 


Wher this spell is cast, the wizard creates 
an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any 
desired color around his person. Half of the 
sphere projects above the ground, and the 
lower hemisphere passes through the 
ground. Up to seven other man-sized crea- 
tures can fit into the field with its creator, 
and these can freely pass into and out of the 
hut without harming it, but if the spellcaster 
removes himself from it, the spell dissipates. 

The temperature inside the hut is 70° FE, if 
the exterior temperature is between 0° and 
100° F. An exterior temperature below 0° or 
above 100° lowers or raises, respectively, 
the interior temperature on a 1°-for-1° 
basis. The tiny hut also provides protection 
against the elements, such as rain, dust, 
sandstorms, and the like. The hut can with- 
stand any wind of less than hurricane force 
without being harmed, but wind force 
greater than that destroys it. 

The interior of the hut is a hemisphere; 
the spellcaster can illuminate it dimly upon 
command, or extinguish the light as desired. 
Note that although the force field is opaque 
from the outside, it is transparent from 
within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell 
effects can pass through the hut without 
affecting it, although the occupants cannot 
be seen from outside the hut. The hut can be 
dispelled. 

The material component for this spell is a 
small crystal bead that shatters when the 
spell duration expires or the hut is dispelled. 


Lightning Bolt (Evocation) 


Range: 40 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Instantaneous 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: 1/2 


Upon casting this spell, the wizard 
releases a powerful stroke of electrical 
energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per 
level of the spellcaster (maximum damage of 
10d6) to each creature within its area of 
effect. A successful saving throw vs. spell 
reduces this damage to half (round fractions 
down). The bolt begins at a range and 
height decided by the caster and streaks out- 
ward in a direct line from the casting wizard 
(e.g., if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet 
from the wizard, the far end of bolt would 
reach 220 feet (180 + 40), The lightning bolt 
may set fire to combustibles, sunder wood- 
en doors, splinter up to '/2 foot thickness of 


Wizard Spells (3rd Level) 


stone, and melt metals with a low melting 
point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). 
Saving throws must be rolled for objects 
that withstand the full force of a stroke (see 
the fireball spell). If the damage caused to an 
interposing barrier shatters or breaks 
through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the 
bolt continues. A bolt can breach one inch 
of wood or 1/2 inch of stone per caster level 
up to a maximum of one foot of wood or ?/2 
foot of stone. 

The lightning bolt's area of effect is cho- 
sen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 
10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt 
five feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt can- 
not reach its full length, because of an 
unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the 
lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier 
toward its caster, ending only when it reach- 
es its full length. 

Example: An 80-foot-long stroke is 
begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone 
wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits 
the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back 
toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from 
the wall, and so is caught in his own light- 
ning bolt!). 

The DM might allow reflecting bolts. 
When this type of lightning bolt strikes a 
solid surface, the bolt reflects from the sur- 
face at an angle equal to the angle of inci- 
dence (like light off a mirror). A creature 
crossed more than once by the bolt must roll 
a saving throw for every time it is crossed, 
but it still suffers either full damage (if one 
saving throw is missed) or half damage (if 
all saving throws are made). 

The material components of the spell are 
a bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass 
rod. 


Melf’s Minute Meteors 
(Evocation, Alteration) 


Range: 70 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 1 target per meteor 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the wizard to cast small 
globes of fire (one for each experience level 
he has attained), each of which bursts into a 
one-foot-diameter sphere upon impact, 
inflicting 1d4 points of damage to the crea- 
ture struck. It can also ignite combustible 
materials (even solid planks). The meteors 
are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard 
with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with 
no penalty for range. Misses are treated as 
grenade-like missiles that inflict 1 point of 
damage to creatures within three feet. 

The spell can be cast in either of two 
ways: 

A) The wizard discharges five meteors 
every round (see the “Multiple Attacks and 


151 


Initiative” section, page 95). Note that this 
carries over into at least the following 
round, 

B) The wizard discharges only one meteor 
per round. In addition to releasing the mis- 
sile, the caster can perform other actions in 
the round, including spellcasting, melee, or 
device use. Spells requiring concentration 
force the wizard to forgo the rest of the mis- 
siles to maintain concentration. Also, if the 
wizard fails to maintain an exact mental 
count of the number of missiles he has 
remaining, he has involuntarily lost the 
remaining portion of the spell. 

The spell ends when the caster has fired 
off as many meteors as he has experience 
levels, when he forgoes casting any still 
remaining, or when a successful dispel mag- 
ic spell is thrown upon the caster. 

The components necessary for the casting 
of this spell are nitre and sulphur formed 
into a bead by the addition of pine tar. The 
caster must also have a small hollow tube of 
minute proportion, fashioned from gold. 
The tube costs no less than 1,000 gp to con- 
struct, so fine is its workmanship and magi- 
cal engraving, and it can be reused. 


Monster Summoning I 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


Within one round of casting this spell, the 
wizard magically conjures 2d4 1st-level 
monsters (selected by the DM, from his 1st- 
level encounter tables). The monsters 
appear in an area within the spell range, as 
desired by the wizard. They attack the spell 
user's opponents to the best of their ability 
until either he commands that the attacks 
cease, the spell duration expires, or the 
monsters are slain. These creatures do not 
check morale, but they vanish when slain. 
Note that if no opponent exists to fight, 
summoned monsters can, if the wizard can 
communicate with them and if they are 
physically able, perform other services for 
the summoning wizard. 

In rare cases, adventurers have been 
known to disappear, summoned by power- 
ful spellcasters using this spell. Those sum- 
moned recall all the details of their trip. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) 
candle. 


Wizard Spells (3rd Level) 


Non-Detection (Abjuration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 hour/level 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 1 creature or item 
Saving Throw: None 


By casting this spell, the wizard makes the 
creature or object touched undetectable by 
divination spells such as clairaudience, 
clairvoyance, locate object, ESP, and detect 
spells. It also prevents location by such 
magical items as crystal balls and ESP me- 
dallions. It does not affect the know align- 
ment spell or the ability of intelligent or 
high-level beings to detect invisible crea- 
tures. If a divination is attempted, the non- 
detection caster must roll a saving throw vs. 
spell. If this is successful, the divination 
fails. 

The material component of the spell is a 
pinch of diamond dust worth 300 gp. 


Phantom Steed (Conjuration, Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard creates 
a quasi-real, horse-like creature. The steed 
can be ridden only by the wizard who cre- 
ated it, or by any person for whom the wiz- 
ard specifically creates such a mount. A 
phantom steed has a black head and body, 
gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, in- 
substantial hooves that make no sound. Its 
eyes are milky-colored. It does not fight, 
but all normal animals shun it and only 
monstrous ones will attack. The mount has 
an Armor Class of 2 and 7 hit points, plus 1 
per level of the caster. If it loses all of its hit 
points, the phantom steed disappears. A 
phantom steed moves at a movement rate of 
4 per level of the spellcaster, to a maximum 
movement rate of 48. It has what seems to 
be a saddle and a bit and bridle. It can bear 
its rider's weight, plus up to 10 pounds per 
caster level. 

These mounts gain certain powers ac- 
cording to the level of the wizard who cre- 
ated them: 

8th Level: The ability to pass over sandy, 
muddy, or even swampy ground without 
difficulty. 

10th Level: The ability to pass over water 
as if it were firm, dry ground. 

12th Level: The ability to travel in the air 
as if it were firm land, so chasms and the like 
can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. 
Note, however, that the mount cannot casu- 
ally take off and fly; the movement must be 
between points of similar altitude. 


14th Level: The ability to perform as if it 
were a pegasus; it flies at a rate of 48 per 
round upon command, 

Note that a mount's abilities include those 
of lower levels; thus a 12th-level mount has 
the 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-level abilities. 


Protection From Evil, 10’ Radius 
(Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere 
around creature touched 

Saving Throw: None 


The globe of protection of this spell is 
identical in all respects to a protection from 
evil spell, except that it encompasses a much 
larger area and its duration is greater. The 
effect is centered on and moves with the 
creature touched. Any protected creature 
within the circle can break the warding 
against enchanted or summoned monsters 
by meleeing them. If a creature too large to 
fit into the area of effect is the recipient of 
the spell, the spell acts as a normal protec- 
tion from evil spell for that creature only. 

To complete this spell, the caster must 
trace a circle 20 feet in diameter using pow- 
dered silver. The material component for 
the reverse is powdered iron. 


Protection From Normal Missiles 
(Abjuration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard bestows 
total invulnerability to hurled and projected 
missiles such as arrows, axes, bolts, jave- 
lins, small stones, and spears. Furthermore, 
it causes a reduction of 1 from each die of 
damage (but no die inflicts less than 1 point 
of damage) inflicted by large or magical 
missiles, such as ballista missiles, catapult 
stones, hurled boulders, and magical ar- 
rows, bolts, javelins, etc. Note, however, 
that this spell does not convey any protec- 
tion from such magical attacks as fireballs, 
lightning bolts, or magic missiles. 

The material component of this spell is a 
piece of tortoise or turtle shell. 


152 


Secret Page (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Until dispelled 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 1 page of any size, 
up to 2 ft. square 

Saving Throw: None 


When cast, a secret page spell alters the 
actual contents of a page so that they appear 
to be something entirely different. Thus a 
map can be changed to become a treatise on 
burnishing ebony walking sticks. The text 
of a spell can be altered to show a ledger 
page or even another form of spell. Confuse 
languages and explosive runes spells may be 
cast upon the secret page, but a comprehend 
languages spell cannot reveal the secret 
page's contents. The caster is able to reveal 
the original contents by speaking a com- 
mand word, perusing the actual page, and 
then returning it to its secret page form. The 
caster can also remove the spell by double 
repetition of the command word. Others 
noting the dim magic of a page with this 
spell cloaking its true contents can attempt 
to dispel magic, but if it fails, the page is de- 
stroyed. A true seeing spell does not reveal 
the contents unless cast in combination with 
a comprehend languages spell. An erase 
spell can destroy the writing. 

The material components are powdered 
herring scales and either will o' wisp or bog- 
gart essence. 


Sepia Snake Sigil 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 5 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 1 sigil 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, a small written 
symbol appears in the text of any written 
work. When read, the so-called sepia snake 
springs into being and strikes at the nearest 
living creature (but does not attack the wiz- 
ard who cast the spell). Its attack is made as 
if it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to 
the level of the wizard who cast the spell. If 
it strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed 
in a shimmering amber field of force, frozen 
and immobilized until released, either at the 
caster's command, by a successful dispel 
magic spell, or until a time equal to 1d4 days 
+ 1 day per caster level has elapsed. Until 
then, nothing can get at the victim, move 
the shimmering force surrounding him, or 
otherwise affect him. The victim does not 
age, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells 
while in this state. He is not aware of his sur- 
roundings. 


Wizard Spells (3rd Level) 


If the sepia snake misses its target, it dissi- 
pates in a flash of brown light, with a loud 
noise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that 
is 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one 
round, 

The spell cannot be detected by normal 
observation, and detect magic reveals only 
that the entire text is magical. A dispel mag- 
ic can remove it; an erase spell destroys the 
entire page of text. It can be cast in combina- 
tion with other spells that hide or garble 
text. 

The components for the spell are 100 gp 
worth of powdered amber, a scale from any 
snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores. 


Slow (Alteration) 


Range: 90 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 40’ cube, 1 creature/level 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A slow spell causes affected creatures to 
move and attack at 2/2 of their normal rates. 
It negates a haste spell or equivalent, but 
does not otherwise affect magically speeded 
or slowed creatures. Slowed creatures have 
an Armor Class penalty of +4 AC, an 
attack penalty of —4, and all Dexterity 
combat bonuses are negated. The magic 
affects a number of creatures equal to the 
spellcaster’s level, if they are within the area 
of effect chosen by the wizard (i.e., a 40- 
foot cubic volume centered as called for by 
the caster). The creatures are affected from 
the center of the spell outward. Saving 
throws against the spell suffer a — 4 penalty. 

The material component of this spell is a 
drop of molasses. 


Spectral Force (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 60 yards + 1 yard/level 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 40’ cube + a 10’ cube/level 
Saving Throw: Special 


The spectral force spell creates an illusion 
in which sound, smell, and thermal illusions 
are included. It is otherwise similar to the 
improved phantasmal force spell. The spell 
last for three rounds after concentration 
ceases. 


Suggestion (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, M 

Duration: 1 hour + 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


When this spell is cast by the wizard, he 
influences the actions of the chosen recipient 
by the utterance of a few words—phrases or 
a sentence or two—suggesting a course of 
action desirable to the spellcaster. The crea- 
ture to be influenced must, of course, be 
able to understand the wizard’s sug- 
gestion—it must be spoken in a language 
that the spell recipient understands. 

The suggestion must be worded in such a 
manner as to make the action sound reason- 
able; asking the creature to stab itself, 
throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or 
do some other obviously harmful act auto- 
matically negates the effect of the spell. 
However, a suggestion that a pool of acid 
was actually pure water and that a quick dip 
would be refreshing is another matter. Urg- 
ing a red dragon to stop attacking the wiz- 
ard’s party so that the dragon and party 
could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere 
is likewise a reasonable use of the spell’s 
power. 

The course of action of a suggestion can 
continue in effect for a considerable dura- 
tion, such as in the case of the red dragon 
mentioned above. Conditions that will trig- 
ger a special action can also be specified; if 
the condition is not met before the spell 
expires, then the action will not be per- 
formed. If the target successfully rolls its 
saving throw, the spell has no effect. Note 
that a very reasonable suggestion causes the 
saving throw to be made with a penalty 
(such as —1, —2, etc.) at the discretion of 
the Dungeon Master. Undead are not sub- 
ject to suggestion. 

The material components of this spell are 
a snake's tongue and either a bit of honey- 
comb or a drop of sweet oil. 


Tongues (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 0 

Components: V, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the wizard to speak and 
understand additional languages, whether 
they are racial tongues or regional dialects. 
This does not enable the caster to speak with 
animals. The spell enables the caster to be 
understood by all creatures of that type 
within hearing distance, usually 60 feet. 


153 


This spell does not predispose the subject 
toward the caster in any way. 

The wizard can speak one additional 
tongue for every three levels of experience. 
The reverse of the spell cancels the effect of 
the tongues spell or confuses verbal com- 
munication of any sort within the area of 
effect. 

The material component is a small clay 
model of a ziggurat, which shatters when 
the spell is pronounced. 


Vampiric Touch (Necromancy) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 
Duration: One touch 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


When the caster touches an opponent in 
melee with a successful attack roll, the 
opponent loses 1d6 hit points for every two 
caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for 
a 12th-level caster. The spell is expended 
when a successful touch is made or one turn 
passes. The hit points are added to the cast- 
er’s total, with any hit points over the cast- 
er’s normal total treated as temporary 
additional hit points. Any damage to the 
caster is subtracted from the temporary hit 
points first. After one hour, any extra hit 
points above the caster’s normal total are 
lost. The creature originally losing hit 
points through this spell can regain them by 
magical or normal healing. Undead crea- 
tures are unaffected by this spell. 


Water Breathing (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration; 1 hour/level + 1d4 hours 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The recipient of a water breathing spell is 
able to breathe water freely for the duration 
of the spell. The caster can touch more than 
one creature with a single casting; in this 
case the duration is divided by the number 
of creatures touched. The reverse, air 
breathing, enables water-breathing crea- 
tures to comfortably survive in the atmos- 
phere for an equal duration. 

The material component of the spell is a 
short reed or piece of straw. 


Wizard Spells (4th Level) 


Wind Wall (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: A 10’ wide * 5’ high area 
per caster level 

Saving Throw: Special 


This spell brings forth an invisible vertical 
curtain of wind two feet thick and of consid- 
erable strength—a strong breeze sufficient 
to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle 
or to tear papers and like materials from 
unsuspecting hands. (If in doubt, a saving 
throw vs. spell determines whether the sub- 
ject maintains its grasp.) Normal insects 
cannot pass such a barrier. Loose materials, 
even cloth garments, fly upward when 
caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are 
deflected upward and miss, while sling 
stones and other missiles under two pounds 
in weight receive a — 4 penalty to a first shot 
and —2 penalties thereafter. Gases, most 
breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous 
form cannot pass this wall, although it is no 
barrier to noncorporeal creatures. 

The material components are a tiny fan 
and a feather of exotic origin. 


Wraithform (Alteration, Illusion) 


Range: 0 

Components: S, M 
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard and all 
of his gear become insubstantial. The caster 
is subject only to magical or special attacks, 
including those by weapons of +1 or better, 
or by creatures otherwise able to affect 
those struck only by magical weapons. 
Undead of most sorts will ignore an individ- 
ual in wraithform, believing him to be a 
wraith or spectre, though a lich or special 
undead may save vs. spell with a —4 penal- 
ty to recognize the spell. 

The wizard can pass through small holes 
or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with 
all he wears or holds in his hands, as long as 
the spell persists. Note, however, that the 
the caster cannot fly without additional 
magic. No form of attack is possible when in 
wraithform, except against creatures that 
exist on the Ethereal plane, where all attacks 
(both ways) are normal. A successful dispel 
magic spell forces the wizard in wraithform 
back to normal form. The spellcaster can 
end the spell with a single word. 

The material components for the spell are 
a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke. 


Fourth-Level Spells 


Charm Monster (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 20- 
foot radius 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell is similar to a charm person 
spell, but it can affect any living creature— 
or several low-level creatures. The spell 
affects 2d4 Hit Dice or levels of creatures, 
although it only affects one creature of 4 or 


154 


more Hit Dice or levels, regardless of the 
number rolled. 

All possible subjects receive saving 
throws vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. Any 
damage inflicted by the caster or his allies in 
the round of casting grants the wounded 
creature another saving throw at a bonus of 
+1 per point of damage received. Any 
affected creature regards the spellcaster as 
friendly, an ally or companion to be treated 
well or guarded from harm. If communica- 
tion is possible, the charmed creature fol- 
lows reasonable requests, instructions, or 
orders most faithfully (see the suggestion 
spell). If communication is not possible, the 
creature does not harm the caster, but others 
in the vicinity may be subject to its inten- 
tions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hos- 
tile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at 
the very least allows a new saving throw 
against the charm. Affected creatures even- 
tually come out from under the influence of 
the spell. This is a function of the creature's 
level (i.e., its Hit Dice). 


Percent Chance/ 
Monster Level Week of 
or Hit Dice Breaking Spell 
1st or up to 2 5% 
2nd or up to3 + 2 10% 
3rd or up to4 + 4 15% 
4th or up to 6 25% 
Sth or up to7 + 2 35 % 
6th or up to 8 +4 45% 
7th or up to 10 60% 
8th or up to 12 75% 
9th or over 12 90% 


The exact day of the week and time of day 
is secretly determined. 


Confusion (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, 5, M 

Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Up to 60-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell causes confusion in one or more 
creatures within the area, creating indeci- 
sion and the inability to take effective 
action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus 
one creature per caster level. These crea- 
tures are allowed saving throws vs. spell 
with —2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. 
Those successfully saving are unaffected by 
the spell. Confused creatures react as fol- 
lows (roll 1d10): 


1 Wander away (unless prevented) 

for duration of spell 

2-6 Stand confused one round 
(then roll again) 

7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round 
(then roll again) 

10 Act normally for one round 
(then roll again) 


Wizard Spells (4th Level) 


The spell lasts for two rounds plus one 
round for each level of the caster. Those 
who fail are checked by the DM for actions 
each round for the duration of the spell, or 
until the “wander away for the duration of 
the spell” result occurs. 

Wandering creatures move as far from the 
caster as possible, according to their most 
typical mode of movement (characters 
walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving 
throws and actions are checked at the begin- 
ning of each round. Any confused creature 
that is attacked perceives the attacker as an 
enemy and acts according to its basic 
nature. 

If there are many creatures involved, the 
DM may decide to assume average results. 
For example, if there are 16 orcs affected 
and 25% could be expected to make the sav- 
ing throw, then four are assumed to have 
succeeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders 
away, four attack the nearest creature, six 
stand confused, and the last acts normally 
but must check next round. Since the orcs 
are not near the party, the DM decides that 
two attacking the nearest creature attack 
each other, one attacks an orc that saved, 
and one attacks a confused orc, which 
strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 
orcs, since four originally saved and one 
wandered off. Another one wanders off, 
five stand confused, four attack, and one 
acts normally. 

The material component is a set of three 
nut shells. 


Contagion (Necromancy) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell causes a major disease and 
weakness in a creature. The afflicted indi- 
vidual is immediately stricken with painful 
and distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, 
lesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. 
Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma are 
reduced by 2. Attack rolls are decreased by 
2. The effect persists until the character 
receives a cure disease spell or spends 1d3 
weeks taking a complete rest to recover. 
Characters ignoring the contagion for more 
than a day or so may be susceptible to worse 
diseases at the discretion of the DM. 


Detect Scrying (Divination) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 120-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Special 


By means of this spell, the wizard imme- 
diately becomes aware of any attempt to 
observe him by means of clairvoyance, 
clairaudience, or magic mirror. This also 
reveals the use of crystal balls or other magi- 
cal scrying devices, provided the attempt is 
within the area of effect of the spell. Since 
the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it 
moves with him, enabling him to “sweep” 
areas for the duration of the spell. 

When a scrying attempt is detected, the 
scryer must immediately roll a saving 
throw. If this is failed, the identity and gen- 
eral location of the scryer immediately 
become known to the wizard who cast this 
spell. The general location is a direction and 
significant landmark close to the scryer. 
Thus, the caster might learn, “The wizard 
Sniggel spies on us from east, under the 
stairs,” or, “You are watched by Asquil in the 
city of Samarquol.” 

The material components for this spell are 
asmall piece of mirror and a miniature brass 
hearing trumpet. 


Dig (Evocation) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 5-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: Special 


A dig spell enables the caster to excavate 
125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per 
round (i.e., a cubic hole five feet on a side). 
In later rounds the caster can expand an 
existing hole or start a new one. The materi- 
al thrown from the excavation scatters 
evenly around the pit. If the wizard con- 
tinues downward past 20 feet in earth, there 
is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This 
check is made for every five feet dug beyond 
20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, 
mud fills in and collapses after five feet, and 
quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug. 

Any creature at the edge (within one foot) 
of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity 
check or fall into the hole. Creatures mov- 
ing rapidly toward a pit dug immediately 
before them must roll a saving throw vs. 
spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a 
pit being excavated can climb out at a rate 
decided by the DM. A creature caught in a 
collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. 
death to avoid being buried; it escapes the 
pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with 
this spell as long as there is space available 


for the material removed. Chances for col- 
lapse are doubled and safe tunneling dis- 
tance is half of the safe excavation depth 
unless such construction is most carefully 
braced and supported. 

The spell is also effective against creatures 
of earth and rock, particularly clay golems 
and those from the elemental plane of Earth. 
When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 
4d6 points of damage. A successful saving 
throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half. 

To activate the spell, the spellcaster needs 
a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and 
must continue to hold them while each pit is 
excavated. These items disappear at the 
conclusion of the spell. 


Dimension Door (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of a dimension door spell, the 
wizard instantly transfers himself up to 30 
yards distance per level of experience. This 
special form of teleportation allows for no 
error, and the wizard always arrives at 
exactly the spot desired—whether by sim- 
ply visualizing the area (within spell transfer 
distance, of course) or by stating direction 
such as, “300 yards straight downward,” or, 
“upward to the northwest, 45 degree angle, 
420 yards.” If the wizard arrives in a place 
that is already occupied by a solid body, he 
remains trapped in the Astral plane. If dis- 
tances are stated and the spellcaster arrives 
with no support below his feet (i.e., in mid- 
air), falling and damage result unless further 
magical means are employed. All that the 
wizard wears or carries, subject to a maxi- 
mum weight equal to 500 pounds of nonliv- 
ing matter, or half that amount of living 
matter, is transferred with the spellcaster. 
Recovery from use of a dimension door 
spell requires one round. 


Emotion (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


When this spell is cast, the wizard can cre- 
ate a single emotional reaction in the subject 
creatures. The following are typical: 

1. Courage: This emotion causes the 
creatures affected to become berserk, fight- 
ing with a +1 bonus to the attack dice, caus- 
ing +3 points of damage, and temporarily 
gaining 5 hit points. The recipients fight 
without shield, and regardless of life, never

checking morale. This spell counters (and is 
countered by) fear. 

2. Fear: The affected creatures flee in 
panic for 2d4 rounds. It counters (and is 
countered by) courage. 

3. Friendship: The affected creatures 
react more positively (e.g., tolerance 
becomes goodwill), It counters (and is coun- 
tered by) hate. 

4. Happiness: This effect creates joy and 
a feeling of complacent well-being, adding 
+4 to all reaction rolls and making attack 
unlikely unless the creatures are subject to 
extreme provocation. It counters (and is 
countered by) sadness. 

5. Hate: The affected creatures react 
more negatively (e.g., tolerance becomes 
negative neutrality). It counters (and is 
countered by) friendship. 

6. Hope: The effect of hope is to raise 
morale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls, and 
damage caused by +2. It counters (and is 
countered by) hopelessness. 

7. Hopelessness: The affected creatures 
submit to the demands of any opponent: 
surrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the crea- 
tures are 25% likely to do nothing in a 
round, and 25% likely to turn back or 
retreat. It counters (and is countered by) 
hope. 

8. Sadness: This creates unhappiness and 
a tendency toward maudlin introspection. 
This emotion increases chances of being sur- 
prised by —1 and adds +1 to initiative rolls. 
It counters (and is countered by) happiness. 


All creatures in the area at the instant the 
spell is cast are affected unless successful 
saving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted 
for Wisdom. The spell lasts as long as the 
wizard continues to concentrate on project- 
ing the chosen emotion. Those who fail the 
saving throw against fear must roll a new 
saving throw if they return to the affected 
area. 


Enchanted Weapon (Enchantment) 
Range: Touch 


—omponents: V, S, M 

Duration: 5 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Weapon(s) touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell turns an ordinary weapon into 
1 magical one. The weapon is the equivalent 
»f a +1 weapon, with +1 to attack and 
lamage rolls. Thus arrows, axes, bolts, 
ows, daggers, hammers, maces, spears, 
words, etc., can be made into temporarily 
mchanted weapons. Two small (arrows, 
olts, daggers, etc.) or one large (axe, bow, 
iammer, mace, etc.) weapon can be affected 
y the spell. The spell functions on existing 
nagical weapons as long as the total com- 
ined bonus is +3 or less. 


Missile weapons enchanted in this way 
lose their enchantment when they success- 
fully hit a target, but otherwise the spell 
lasts its full duration. This spell is often used 
in combination with the enchant an item 
and permanency spells to create magical 
weapons, with this spell being cast once per 
desired plus of the bonus. 

The material components of this spell are 
powdered lime and carbon. 


Enervation (Necromancy) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1d4 hours + 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell temporarily suppresses the sub- 
ject's life force. The necromancer points his 
finger and utters the incantation, releasing a 
black bolt of crackling energy. The subject 
must roll a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted 
for Dexterity, to avoid the bolt. Success 
means the spell has no effect. Failure means 
the subject is treated exactly as if he had 
been drained of energy levels by a wight, 
one level for every four levels of the caster. 
Hit Dice, spells, and other character details 
dependent on level are lost or reduced. 
Those drained to Oth level must make a sys- 
tem shock check to survive and are helpless 
until the spell expires. The spell effect even- 
tually wears off, either after 1d4 hours plus 
one hour per caster level, or after six hours 
of complete and undisturbed rest. Level 
abilities are regained, but lost spells must be 
rememorized. Undead are immune to this 
spell. 


Evard’s Black Tentacles 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 30 sq. ft./level 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell creates many rubbery, black 
tentacles in the area of effect. These waving 
members seem to spring forth from the 
earth, floor, or whatever surface is 
underfoot—including water. Each tentacle 
is 10 feet long, AC 4, and requires as many 
points of damage to destroy as the level of 
the wizard who cast the spell. There are 1d4 
such tentacles, plus one per experience level 
of the spellcaster. 

Any creature within range of the writhing 
tentacles is subject to attack as determined by 
the DM. The target of a tentacle attack must 
roll a saving throw vs. spell. If this succeeds, 
the subject suffers 1d4 points of damage from 


157 


contact with the tentacle, and then the tentacle 
is destroyed. Failure to save indicates that the 
damage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon mem- 
ber is wrapped around its subject, and damage 
will be 3d4 points on the second and succeed- 
ing rounds, Since these tentacles have no intel- 
ligence to guide them, there is the possibility 
that they entwine any object—a tree, post, pil- 
lar, even the wizard himself—or continue to 
squeeze a dead opponent. A grasping hold 
established by a tentacle remains until the ten- 
tacle is destroyed by some form of attack or 
until it disappears at the end of the spell’s dura- 
tion. 

The component for this spell is a piece of 
tentacle from a giant octopus or giant squid. 


Extension I (Alteration) 


Range: 0 
Components: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By use of an extension | spell, the wizard 
prolongs the duration of a previously cast 
1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell by 50%. Thus, 
a levitation spell can be made to function 15 
minutes/level, a hold person spell made to 
work for three rounds/level, etc. Naturally, 
the spell affects only spells that have dura- 
tions. This spell must be cast immediately 
after the spell to be extended, either by the 
original caster or another wizard. If a com- 
plete round or more elapses, the extension 
fails and is wasted. 


Fear (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 60’ long cone, 30' diameter 
at end, 5’ at base 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


When a fear spell is cast, the wizard sends 
forth an invisible cone of terror that causes 
creatures within its area of effect to turn 
away from the caster and flee in panic. 
Affected creatures are likely to drop what- 
ever they are holding when struck by the 
spell; the base chance of this is 60% at Ist 
level (or at 1 Hit Die), and each level (or Hit 
Die) above this reduces the probability by 
5%. Thus at 10th level there is only a 15% 
chance, and at 13th level no chance, of 
dropping items. Creatures affected by fear 
flee at their fastest rate for a number of 
melee rounds equal to the level of experi- 
ence of the spellcaster. Undead and crea- 
tures that successfully roll their saving 
throws vs. the spell are not affected. 

The material component of this spell is 
either the heart of a hen or a white feather. 


Wizard Spells (4th Level) 


Fire Charm (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 15-foot radius of fire 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell the wizard causes a 
normal fire source, such as a brazier, flam- 
beau, or bonfire, to serve as a magical 
agent, for from this source he causes a gos- 
samer veil of multi-hued flame to encircle 
the fire at five feet distance. Any creatures 
observing the fire or the dancing circle of 
flame around it must successfully roll a sav- 
ing throw vs. spell or be charmed into 
remaining motionless and gazing, trans- 
fixed, at the flames. While so charmed, 
creatures are subject to suggestions of 12 or 
fewer words, saving vs. spell with a —3 pen- 
alty, adjusted for Wisdom, The caster can 
give one such suggestion to each creature, 
and the suggestions need not be the same. 
The maximum duration for such a sugges- 
tion is one hour, regardless of the caster’s 
level. 

The fire charm is broken if the charmed 
creature is physically attacked, if a solid 
object comes between the creature and the 
veil of flames so as to obstruct vision, or 
when the duration of the spell expires. 
Those exposed to the fire charm again may 
be affected at the DM's option, although 
bonuses may also be allowed to the saving 
throws. Note that the veil of flame is not a 
magical fire, and passing through it incurs 
the same damage as would be sustained 
from passing through its original fire 
source. 

The material component for this spell is a 
small piece of multi-colored silk of excep- 
tional thinness that the spellcaster must 
throw into the fire source. 


Fire Shield (Evocation, Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: The caster 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell can be cast in one of two 
forms: a warm shield that protects against 
cold-based attacks, or a chill shield that pro- 
tects against fire-based attacks. Both return 
damage to creatures making physical 
attacks against the wizard. The wizard must 
choose which variation he memorizes when 
the spell is selected. 

When casting this spell, the wizard 
appears to immolate himself, but the flames 
are thin and wispy, shedding no heat, 
though giving light equal to only half the 
illumination of a normal torch. The color of 


the flames is determined randomly (50% 
chance of either color)—blue or green if the 
chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm 
shield is employed. The special powers of 
each shield are as follows: 

A) Warm shield. The flames are warm to 
the touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved 
against with a +2 bonus; either half normal 
damage or no damage is sustained. There is 
no bonus against fire-based attacks, but if 
the wizard fails to make the required saving 
throw (if any) against them, he sustains 
double normal damage. 

The material component for this varia- 
tion is a bit of phosphorus. 

B) Chill shield. The flames are cool to the 
touch. Any fire-based attacks are saved 
against with a +2 bonus; either half normal 
damage or no damage is sustained. There is 
no bonus against cold-based attacks, but if 
the wizard fails to make the required saving 
throw (if any) against them, he sustains 
double normal damage. 

The material component for this varia- 
tion is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail 
portions of four dead ones. 

Any creature striking the spellcaster with 
its body or hand-held weapons inflicts nor- 
mal damage upon the wizard, but the 
attacker suffers the same amount of dam- 
age. An attacker's magical resistance, if any, 
is tested when the creature actually strikes 
the wizard. Successful resistance shatters 
the spell. Failure means the creature's magic 
resistance does not affect that casting of the 


spell. 


Fire Trap (Abjuration, Evocation) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent until discharged 
Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Object touched 
Saving Throw: 1/2 


Any closeable item (book, box, bottle, 
chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so 
forth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The 
spell is centered on a point selected by the 
spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have 
a second closure or warding spell placed 
upon it (if such is attempted, the result is 
25% first spell fails, 25% second spell fails, 
or 50% both spells fail). A knock spell does 
not affect a fire trap in any way—as soon as 
the offending party enters or touches the 
item, the trap discharges. Thieves and oth- 
ers have only 1/2 of their normal chance to 
detect a fire trap (by noticing the character- 
istic markings required to cast the spell). 
They have only 1/2 their normal chance to 
remove the trap (failure detonates the trap 
immediately). An unsuccessful dispel does 
not detonate the spell. The caster can use the 
trapped object without discharging it, as 
can any individual to whom the spell was 


specifically attuned when cast (the exact 
method usually involves a keyword). When 
the trap is discharged, there is an explosion 
of five-foot radius from the spell’s center; all 
creatures within this area must roll saving 
throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 
1 point per level of the caster; half this 
(round up) for creatures successfully saving. 
(Underwater, this ward inflicts half damage 
and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item 
trapped is not harmed by this explosion. 

To place this spell, the caster must trace 
the outline of the closure with a bit of sul- 
phur or saltpeter and touch the center of the 
effect. Attunement to another individual 
requires a hair or similar object from that 
person. 


Fumble (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


When a fumble spell is cast, the wizard 
creates an area in which all creatures sud- 
denly become clumsy and awkward. Run- 
ning creatures trip and fall, those reaching 
for an item drop it, those employing weap- 
ons likewise awkwardly drop them, etc. 
Recovery from a fall or to pick up a fumbled 
object typically requires a successful saving 
throw and takes one round. Note that 
breakable items might suffer damage when 
dropped. A subject succeeding with his sav- 
ing throw can act freely that round, but if he 
is in the area at the beginning of the next 
round, another saving throw is required. 
Alternatively, the spell can be cast at an 
individual creature. Failure to save means 
the creature is affected for the spell’s entire 
duration; success means the creature is 
slowed (see the 3rd-level spell). 

The material component of this spell is a 
dab of solidified milk fat. 


Hallucinatory Terrain 
(Ilusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 20 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 hour/level 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Cube up to 30' per side/level 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard causes 
an illusion that hides the actual terrain with- 
in the area of effect. Thus open fields or a 
road can be made to look like a swamp, hill, 
crevasse, or some other difficult or impass- 
able terrain. A pond can be made to look 
like a grassy meadow, a precipice look like a 
gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully made to 


Wizard Spells (4th Level) 


look like a wide and smooth road. The hal- 
lucinatory terrain persists until a dispel 
magic spell is cast upon the area or until the 
duration expires. Individual creatures may 
see through the illusion, but the illusion per- 
sists, affecting others who observe the 
scene. 

If the illusion involves only a subtle 
change, such as causing an open wood to 
appear thick and dark, or increasing the 
slope of a hill, the effect may be unnoticed 
even by those in the midst of it. If the change 
is extreme, a grassy plain covering a seeth- 
ing field of volcanic mudpots, for instance, 
the illusion will no doubt be noticed the 
instant one person falls prey to it. Each level 
of experience expands the dimensions of the 
area affected, e.g., a 12th-level caster affects 
a 120 yd. x 120 yd. x 120 yd. area. 

The material components of this spell are 
a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant— 
leaf or grass blade. 


ice Storm (Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell can have one of two effects, at 
the caster’s option: Either great hail stones 
pound down for one round in a 40-foot- 
diameter area and inflict 3d10 points of 
damage to any creatures within the area of 
effect, or driving sleet falls in an 80-foot- 
diameter area for one round per caster level. 
The sleet blinds creatures within its area for 
the duration of the spell and causes the 
ground in the area to be icy, thus slowing 
movement by 50% and making it 50% 
probable that a creature trying to move in 
the area slips and falls. The sleet also extin- 
guishes torches and small fires. 

Note that this spell will negate a heat 
metal spell. 

The material components for this spell are 
a pinch of dust and a few drops of water. 


Illusionary Wall (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1’ X 10’ X 10’ 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell creates the illusion of a wall, 
floor, ceiling, or similar surface, which is 
permanent until dispelled. It appears abso- 
lutely real when viewed, even magically, as 
with the clerical spell, true seeing, or its 
equivalent, but physical objects can pass 
through it without difficulty. When the spell 
is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, 


normal demihuman and magical detection 
abilities work normally, and touch or prob- 
ing searches reveal the true nature of the 
surface, though they do not cause the illu- 
sion to disappear. 

The material component is a rare dust 
that costs at least 400 gp and requires four 
days to prepare. 


Improved Invisibility 
(Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell is similar to the invisibility 
spell, but the recipient is able to attack, 
either by missile discharge, melee combat, 
or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, 
however, that there are sometimes telltale 
traces, a shimmering, so that an observant 
opponent can attack the invisible spell 
recipient. These traces are only noticeable 
when specifically looked for (after the invis- 
ible character has made his presence 
known). Attacks against the invisible char- 
acter suffer —4 penalties to the attack rolls, 
and the invisible character's saving throws 
are made with a +4 bonus. High Hit Dice 
creatures that might notice invisible oppo- 
nents will notice a creature under this spell 
as if they had 2 fewer Hit Dice (they roll sav- 
ing throws vs. spell; success indicates they 
spot the character). 


Leomund’s Secure Shelter 
(Alteration, Enchantment) 


Range: 20 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1d4+1 hours + 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 4 turns 

Area of Effect: 30 sq. ft./level 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the wizard to magically 
call into being a sturdy cottage or lodge, 
made of material that is common in the area 
where the spell is cast—stone, timber, or (at 
worst) sod. The floor area of the lodging is 
30 square feet per level of the spellcaster, 
and the surface is level, clean, and dry. In all 
respects the lodging resembles a normal cot- 
tage, with a sturdy door, two or more shut- 
tered windows, and a small fireplace. 

While the lodging is secure against winds 
of up to 70 miles per hour, it has no heating 
or cooling source (other than natural insula- 
tion qualities). Therefore it must be heated 
as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat 
adversely affects it and its occupants. The 
dwelling does, however, provide considera- 
ble security otherwise, as it is as strong as a 


159 


normal stone building, regardless of its 
material composition, resists flames and fire 
as if it were stone, and is impervious to nor- 
mal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege 
machinery or giants). 

The door, shutters, and even chimney are 
secure against intrusion, the former two 
being wizard locked and the latter being 
secured by a top grate of iron and a narrow 
flue. In addition, these three areas are pro- 
tected by an alarm spell. Lastly, an unseen 
servant is called up to provide service to the 
spellcaster. 

The inside of the shelter contains rude 
furnishings as desired by the spellcaster—up 
to eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, 
as many as four chairs or eight stools, and a 
writing desk. 

The material components of this spell are 
a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few 
grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and 
several splinters of wood. These must be 
augmented by the components of the alarm 
and unseen servant spells if these benefits 
are to be included (string and silver wire and 
a small bell). 


Magic Mirror (Enchantment, Divination) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard changes 
a normal mirror into a scrying device simi- 
lar to a crystal ball. The details of the use of 
such a scrying device are found in the DMG 
under the description for the crystal ball. 

The mirror used must be of finely 
wrought and highly polished silver of a min- 
imum cost not less than 1,000 gp. This mir- 
ror is not harmed by casting the spell, but 
the other material components—the eye of a 
hawk, an eagle, or even a roc, and nitric 
acid, copper, and zinc—are used up. 

The following spells can be cast through a 
magic mirror: comprehend languages, read 
magic, tongues, and infravision. The fol- 
lowing spells have a 5% chance per level of 
the caster of operating correctly: detect 
magic, detect good or evil, and message. 
The base chances for the subject to detect 
any crystal ball-like spell is listed in the crys- 
tal ball entry in the DMG (see the “Miscella- 
neous Magic” section). 


Wizard Spells (4th Level) 


Massmorph (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: None 


Wher this spell is cast upon willing crea- 
tures of man-size or smaller, up to 10 such 
creatures per level of the caster can be magi- 
cally altered to appear as trees of any sort. 
Thus a company of creatures can be made to 
appear as a copse, grove, or orchard. Fur- 
thermore, these massmorphed creatures can 
be passed through—and even touched—by 
other creatures without revealing their true 
nature. Note, however, that blows to the 
creature-trees cause damage, and blood can 
be seen. 

Creatures to be massmorphed must be 
within the spell’s area of effect and unwilling 
creatures are not affected. Affected crea- 
tures remain unmoving but aware, subject 
to normal sleep requirements, and able to 
see, hear, and feel for as long as the spell is in 
effect. The spell persists until the caster 
commands it to cease or until a dispel magic 
spell is cast upon the creatures. Creatures 
left in this state for extended periods are 
subject to insects, weather, disease, fire, and 
other natural hazards. 

The material component of this spell is a 
handful of bark chips from the type of tree 


the creatures are to become. 


Minor Creation (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the wizard to create an 
item of non-living, vegetable nature—soft 
goods, rope, wood, etc. The caster actually 
pulls wisps of material of the plane of 
Shadow from the air and weaves them into 
the desired item. The volume of the item 
created cannot exceed one cubic foot per 
level of the spellcaster. The item remains in 
existence for only as long as the spell’s dura- 
tion. 

The spellcaster must have at least a tiny 
piece of matter of the same type of item he 
plans to create by means of the minor crea- 
tion spell—a bit of twisted hemp to create 
rope, a splinter of wood to create a door, 
and so forth. 


Minor Globe of Invulnerability 
(Abjuration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell creates an immobile, faintly 
shimmering magical sphere around the 
caster that prevents any Ist-, 2nd-, or 3rd- 
level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the 
area of effect of any such spells does not in- 
clude the area of the minor globe of invul- 
nerability). This includes innate abilities 
and effects from devices. However, any 
type of spell can be cast out of the magical 
sphere, and these pass from the caster of the 
globe to their subject without affecting the 
minor globe. Fourth and higher level spells 
are not affected by the globe. The globe can 
be brought down by a successful dispel 
magic spell. The caster can leave and return 
to the globe without penalty. Note that spell 
effects are not actually disrupted by the 
globe unless cast directly through or into 
it: The caster would still see a mirror image 
created by a wizard outside the globe. If that 
wizard then entered the globe, the images 
would wink out, to reappear when the wiz- 
ard exited the globe. Likewise, a wizard 
standing in the area of a light spell would 
still receive sufficient light for vision, even 
though that part of the light spell volume in 
the globe would not be luminous. 

The material component of the spell is a 
glass or crystal bead that shatters at the ex- 
piration of the spell. 


Monster Summoning Il 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 40 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- 
ster summoning I spell, except that this spell 
summons 1d6 2nd-level monsters. These ap- 
pear anywhere within the spell range and at- 
tack the caster’s opponents, until he 
commands them to cease, the spell duration 
expires, or the monsters are slain. These 
creatures do not check morale; they vanish 
when slain. If no opponent exists to fight 
and the wizard can communicate with 
them, the summoned monsters can perform 
other services for the summoning wizard. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) 
candle.

Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere 
(Alteration, Evocation) 


Range: 20 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1-foot diameter/level 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


When this spell is cast, the result is a globe 
of shimmering force that encloses the sub- 
ject creature—if it is small enough to fit 
within the diameter of the sphere and it fails 
to successfully save vs. spell. The resilient 
sphere contains its subject for the spell’s du- 
ration, and it is not subject to damage of any 
sort except from a rod of cancellation, a 
wand of negation, or a disintegrate or dispel 
magic spell. These cause it to be destroyed 
without harm to the subject. Nothing can 
pass through the sphere, inside or out, 
though the subject can breathe normally. 
The subject may struggle, but all that occurs 
is a movement of the sphere. The globe can 
be physically moved either by people out- 
side the globe or by the struggles of those 
within. 

The material components of the spell are 
a hemispherical piece of diamond (or similar 
hard, clear gem material) and a matching 
hemispherical piece of gum arabic. 


Phantasmal Killer (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 


Wher this spell is cast, the wizard creates 
the illusion of the most fearsome thing 
imaginable to the victim, simply by forming 
the fears of the victim's subconscious mind 
into something that its conscious mind can 
visualize—the most horrible beast. Only the 
spell recipient can see the phantasmal killer 
(the caster sees only a shadowy shape), but 
if it succeeds in scoring a hit, the subject dies 
from fright. The beast attacks as a 4 Hit Dice 
monster, It is invulnerable to all attacks, 
and it can pass through any barriers. Once 
cast, it inexorably pursues the subject, for it 
exists only in the subject’s mind. 

The only defenses against a phantasmal 
killer are an attempt to disbelieve (which 
can be tried but once), slaying or rendering 
unconscious the wizard who cast the spell, 
or rendering unconscious the target of the 
spell for its duration. To disbelieve the killer, 
the subject must specifically state the at- 
tempt and then roll an Intelligence check. 
This roll has a —1 penalty for every four 
levels of the caster. 


Special modifiers apply to this attack: 


Condition Modifier 
Surprise =2 
Subject previously attacked by 

this spell +1/ 
Subject is an illusionist 2 


Subject is wearing a helm of telepathy +3 


Magic resistance, bonuses against fear, 
and Wisdom adjustments also apply. Magic 
resistance is checked first to determine spell 
operation, and then the fear/Wisdom bonus 
applies as a minus to the dice roll to match 
or score less than Intelligence. 

If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack 
succeeds in disbelieving, and he is wearing a 
helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned 
upon the wizard, who must then disbelieve 
it or be subject to its attack and possible 
effects. 

If the subject ignores the killer to perform 
other actions, such as attacking the caster, 
the killer may, at the DM’s option, gain 
bonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks, 
etc.). Spells such as remove fear and cloak 
of bravery, cast after the killer has attacked, 
grant another check to disbelieve the effect. 


Plant Growth (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: An area 10’ per side/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When a plant growth spell is cast, the wiz- 
ard causes normal vegetation to grow, 
entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or 
jungle that creatures must hack or force a 
way through at a movement rate of 1 per 
round (or 2 if larger than man-sized), The 
area must contain brush and trees for this 
spell to work. Briars, bushes, creepers, 
lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, 
vines, and weeds become thick and over- 
grown so as to form a barrier. The area of 
effect is 10 feet on a side per level of experi- 
ence of the caster, in any square or rectangu- 
lar shape that the caster desires. Thus an 
8th-level wizard can affect an 80' X 80’ 
square, a 160’ X 40’ rectangle, a 640’ 10’ 
rectangle, etc. Individual plant girth and 
height is generally affected less than thick- 
ness of brush, branch, and undergrowth. 
The spell’s effects persist in the area until it is 
cleared by labor, fire, or such magical 
means as a dispel magic spell. 


Wizard Spells (4th Level) 


Polymorph Other (Alteration) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The polymorph other spell is a powerful 
magic that completely alters the form and 
ability, and possibly the personality and 
mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while 
a creature with a lower Intelligence can be 
polymorphed in form into something with a 
higher Intelligence, it will not gain that crea- 
ture’s mental ability. The reverse—poly- 
morphing a higher Intelligence creature into 
one of significantly lower Intelligence— 
results in a creature much more intelligent 
than appearances would lead one to believe. 
The polymorphed creature must succeed on 
a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it 
survives the change. After this, it must 
make a special Intelligence check to see if it 
retains its personality (see following). 

The polymorphed creature acquires the 
form and physical abilities of the creature it 
has been polymorphed into, while retaining 
its own mind. Form includes natural Armor 
Class (that due to skin toughness, but not 
due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), 
physical movement abilities (walking, 
swimming, flight with wings, but not plane 
shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and 
attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, 
rake, constriction, but not petrification, 
breath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit 
points and saving throws do not change 
from the original form. Noncorporeal forms 
cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters 
(lycanthropes, dopplegangers, higher level 
druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, 
and can then resume their normal form. 

If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts 
to its original form (it’s still dead, though). 
(Note that most creatures generally prefer 
their own form and will not willingly stand 
the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As 
class and level are not attributes of form, 
abilities derived from either cannot be 
gained by this spell, nor can exact ability 
scores be specified. 

When the polymorph occurs, the crea- 
ture’s equipment, if any, melds into the new 
form (in particularly challenging cam- 
paigns, the DM may allow protective 
devices, such as a ring of protection, to con- 
tinue operating effectively). The creature 
retains its mental abilities, including spell 
use, assuming the new form allows comple- 
tion of the proper verbal and somatic com- 
ponents and the material components are 
available. Creatures not used to a new form 
might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g., 
—2 to attack rolls) until they practice suffi- 
ciently to master it. 


When the physical change occurs, there is 
a base 100% chance that the subject's per- 
sonality and mentality change into that of 
new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). 
For each 1 point of Intelligence of the sub- 
ject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 
1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of dif- 
ference between the original form and the 
form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 
(depending on whether polymorphed form 
has more Hit Dice [or levels] or fewer Hit 
Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). 
The chance for assumption of the personali- 
ty and mentality of the new form is checked 
daily until the change takes place. 

A subject acquiring the mentality of the 
new form has effectively become the crea- 
ture whose form was assumed and comes 
under the control of the DM until recovered 
by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this 
final change takes place, the creature 
acquires the new form’s full range of magi- 
cal and special abilities. 

Example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelli- 
gence is polymorphed into a white dragon 
with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20 - 
8 Intelligence + 5 level difference [6-1] = 17 
out of 20 = 85%) likely to actually become 
one in all respects, but in any case it has the 
dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If 
it does not assume the personality and men- 
tality of a white dragon, it knows what it 
formerly knew as well. ; 

The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to 
change the polymorphed creature back to 
its original from, and this requires a system 
shock roll. Those who have lost their indi- 
viduality and are then converted back main- 
tain the belief that they are actually the 
polymorphed creature and attempt to 
return to that form. Thus the orc who comes 
to believe he is a white dragon, when con- 
verted back to his orc form, steadfastly 
maintains he is really a white dragon poly- 
morphed into the shape of an orc. His com- 
panions will most likely consider him mad. 

The material component of this spell is a 
caterpillar cocoon. 


Polymorph Self (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V 
Duration: 2 turns/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


Wher this spell is cast, the wizard is able 
to assume the form of any creature, save 
those that are noncorporeal, from as small 
as a wren to as large as a hippopotamus. 
Furthermore, the wizard gains its physical 
mode of locomotion and breathing as well. 
No system shock roll is required. The spell 
does not give the new form’s other abilities 
(attack, magic, special movement, etc.), nor 


Wizard Spells (4th Level) 


does it run the risk of changing personality 
and mentality. 

When the polymorph occurs, the caster’s 
equipment, if any, melds into the new form 
(in particularly challenging campaigns, the 
DM may allow protective devices, such as a 
ring of protection, to continue operating 
effectively). The caster retains all mental 
abilities, including spell use, assuming the 
new form allows completion of the proper 
verbal and somatic components and the 
material components are available. A caster 
not used to a new form might be penalized 
at the DM's option (e.g., —2 penalty to 
attack rolls) until he practices sufficiently to 
master it. 

Thus a wizard changed into an owl could 
fly, but his vision would be human; a 
change to a black pudding would enable 
movement under doors or along halls and 
ceilings, but not the pudding’s offensive 
(acid) or defensive capabilities. Naturally, 
the strength of the new form is sufficient to 
enable normal movement. The spellcaster 
can change his form as often as desired for 
the duration of the spell, each change 
requiring a round. The wizard retains his 
own hit points, attack rolls, and saving 
throws. The wizard can end the spell at any 
time; when voluntarily returning to his own 
form and ending the spell, he regains 1d12 
hit points. The wizard also will return to his 
own form when slain or when the effect is 
dispelled, but no hit points are restored in 
these cases. 


Rainbow Pattern 
(Alteration, Iusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell, the wizard creates 
a glowing, rainbow-hued band of inter- 
weaving patterns. Any creature caught in it 
may become fascinated and gaze at it as 
long as the effect lasts. The spell can capti- 
vate a maximum of 24 levels, or Hit Dice, of 
creatures—24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each, 
12 with 2 Hit Dice, etc. All creatures affect- 
ed must be within the area of effect, and 
each is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. 
An attack on an affected creature that 
causes damage frees it from the spell imme- 
diately. Creatures that are restrained and 
removed from the area still try to follow the 
pattern. 

Once the rainbow pattern is cast, the wiz- 
ard need only gesture in the direction he 
desires, and the pattern of colors moves 
slowly off in that direction, at the rate of 30 
feet per round. It persists without further 
attention from the spellcaster for 1d3 


rounds. All affected creatures follow the 
moving rainbow of light. If the pattern leads 
its subjects into a dangerous area (through 
flame, off a cliff, etc.), allow a second sav- 
ing throw. If the view of the lights is com- 
pletely blocked (by an obscurement spell, 
for instance), the spell is negated. 

The wizard need not utter a sound, but he 
must gesture appropriately while holding a 
crystal prism and the material component, a 
piece of phosphor. 


Rary’s Mnemonic Enhancer 
(Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 day 

Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard is able 
to memorize, or retain the memory of, three 
additional spell levels (three 1st-level spells, 
or one Ist and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level 
spell). The wizard has two options: 

A) Memorize additional spells. This 
option is taken at the time the spell is cast. 
The additional spells must be memorized 
normally and any material components 
must be acquired. 

B) Retain memory of any spell (within the 
level limits) cast the round prior to starting 
to cast this spell. The round after a spell is 
cast, the enhancer must be successfully cast. 
This restores the previously cast spell to 
memory. Any material components must be 
acquired by the caster, however. 

The material components of the spell are 
a piece of string, an ivory plaque of at least 
100 gp value, and ink consisting of squid 
secretion with either black dragon's blood 
or giant slug digestive juice. These disap- 
pear when the spell is cast. 


Remove Curse (Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


Upon casting this spell, the wizard is usu- 
ally able to remove a curse—whether it is on 
an object, or a person, or in the form of 
some undesired sending or evil presence. 
Note that the remove curse spell cannot 
affect a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of 
armor, for example, although it usually 
enables a person afflicted with a cursed item 
to be rid of it. Certain special curses may not 
be countered by this spell, or may be coun-

more. A caster of 12th level or more can 
cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it 
on the animal form. The were-creature 
receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if suc- 
cessful, the spell fails and the wizard must 
gain a level before attempting the remedy 


again. 

The reverse of the spell is not permanent; 
the bestow curse lasts for one turn for every 
experience level of the wizard casting the 
spell. It causes one of the following effects 
(roll percentile dice): 


D100 

Roll Result 

1-50 Lowers one ability of the subject to 
3 (the DM determines which by 
random selection) 

51-75 Worsens the subject's attack rolls 
and saving throws by —4 

76-00 Makes the subject 50% likely per 
turn to drop whatever it is holding 
(or simply do nothing, in the case 
of creatures not using tools) 


It is possible for a wizard to devise his 
own curse, and it should be similar in power 
to those given (the DM has final say). The 
subject of a bestow curse spell must be 
touched. If the subject is touched, a saving 
throw is still applicable; if it is successful, 
the effect is negated. The bestowed curse 
cannot be dispelled. 


Shadow Monsters (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


A wizard casting the shadow monsters 
spell uses material from the plane of 
Shadow to shape semi-real illusions of one 
or more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the 
shadow monster or monsters thus created 
cannot exceed the level of experience of the 
wizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create 
one creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that 
have 5S Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters 
created by one spell must be of the same 
sort. The actual hit point total for each 
monster is 20% of the hit point total it 
would normally have. (To determine this, 
roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply 
the hit points by .2. Any remainder less than 
.4 is dropped—in the case of monsters with 
1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the mon- 
ster was not successfully created—and 
scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 
hit point.) 

Those viewing the shadow monsters are 
allowed to disbelieve as per normal illu- 
sions, although there is a —2 penalty to the 
attempt. The shadow monsters perform as 
the real monsters with respect to Armor 


Wizard Spells (4th Level) 


Class and attack forms. Those who believe 
in the shadow monsters suffer real damage 
from their attacks. Special attack forms 
such as petrification or level drain do not 
actually occur, but a subject who believes 
they are real will react appropriately. 

Those who roll successful saving throws 
see the shadow monsters as transparent 
images superimposed on vague shadowy 
forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict 
only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, 
clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional 
damage less than .4 as done with hit points. 

Example: A shadow monster griffon 
attacks a person who knows it is only quasi- 
real. The monster strikes with two claw 
attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die 
monster. All three attacks hit, and the nor- 
mal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by .2 
separately, rounded up or down, then added 
together to get total damage. Thus if the 
attacks score 4, 2, and 11 points, then a total 
of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x .2 = 
.8 [rounded to 1], 2 X .2 = .4 [rounded to 
1], 11 X .2 = 2.2 [rounded to 2]. The sum is 
1+1+2 = 4). 


Shout (Evocation) 


Range: 0 

Components: V,M 

Duration: Instantaneous 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 10-foot X 30-foot cone 
Saving Throw: Special 


When a shout spell is cast, the wizard 
gives himself tremendous vocal powers. 
The caster can emit an ear-splitting noise 
that has a principal effect in a cone shape 
radiating from his mouth to a point 30 feet 
away. Any creature within this area is deaf- 
ened for 2d6 rounds and suffers 2d6 points 
of damage. A successful saving throw vs. 
spell negates the deafness and reduces the 
damage by half. Any exposed brittle or 
crystal substance subject to sonic vibrations 
is shattered by a shout, while those brittle 
objects in the possession of a creature 
receive the creature's saving throw. Deaf- 
ened creatures suffer a —1 penalty to sur- 
prise rolls, and those that cast spells with 
verbal components are 20% likely to mis- 
cast them. 

The shout spell cannot penetrate the 2nd- 
level clerical spell, silence, 10’ radius. This 
spell can be employed but once per day, for 
otherwise the caster might permanently 
deafen himself. 

The material components for this spell are 
a drop of honey, a drop of citric acid, and a 
small cone made from a bull or ram horn. 


Solid Fog (Alteration) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 20’ X 10’ X 10' volume/ 
level of caster 

Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard creates 
a billowing mass of misty vapors similar to 
a wall of fog spell. The caster can create less 
vapor if desired, as long as a rectangular or 
cubic mass at least 10 feet on a side is 
formed. The fog obscures all sight, normal 
and infravision, beyond two feet. However, 
unlike normal fog, only a very strong wind 
can move these vapors, and any creature 
attempting to move through the solid fog 
progresses at a rate of but one foot per 
movement rate of 1 per round. A gust of 
wind spell cannot affect it. A fireball, flame 
strike, or a wall of fire can burn it away ina 
single round. 

The material components for the spell are 
a pinch of dried, powdered peas combined 
with powdered animal hoof. 


Stoneskin (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the affected crea- 
ture gains a virtual immunity to any attack 
by cut, blow, projectile, or the like. Even a 
sword of sharpness cannot affect a creature 
protected by stoneskin, nor can a rock 
hurled by a giant, a snake's strike, etc. How- 
ever, magical attacks from such spells as 
fireball, magic missile, lightning bolt, and 
so forth have their normal effects. The spell 
blocks 1d4 attacks, plus one attack per two 
levels of experience the caster has achieved. 
This limit applies regardless of attack rolls 
and regardless of whether the attack was 
physical or magical. For example, a 
stoneskin spell cast by a 9th-level wizard 
would protect against from five to eight 
attacks. An attacking griffon would reduce 
the protection by three each round; four 
magic missiles would count as four attacks 
in addition to inflicting their normal dam- 
age. 

The material components of the spell are 
granite and diamond dust sprinkled on the 
recipient's skin.

Vacancy (Alteration, [llusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 hour/level 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When a vacancy spell is cast, the wizard 
causes an area to appear to be vacant, 
neglected, and unused. Those who behold 
the area see dust on the floor, cobwebs, dirt, 
and other conditions typical of a long- 
abandoned place. If they pass through the 
area of effect, they seem to leave tracks, tear 
away cobwebs, and so on. Unless they actu- 
ally contact some object cloaked by the 
spell, the place appears empty. Merely 
brushing an invisible object does not cause 
the vacancy spell to be disturbed: Only 
forceful contact grants a chance to note that 
all is not as it seems. 

If forceful contact with a cloaked object 
occurs, those creatures subject to the spell 
can penetrate the spell only if they discover 
several items that they cannot see; each 
being is then entitled to a saving throw vs. 
spell. Failure means they believe that the 
objects are invisible. A dispel magic spell 
cancels this spell so that the true area is seen. 
A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, and sim- 
ilar effects can penetrate the deception, but 
a detect invisibility spell cannot. 

This spell is a very powerful combination 
of invisibility and illusion, but it can cloak 
only nonliving things. Living things are not 
made invisible, but their presence does not 
otherwise disturb the spell. 

The wizard must have a square of the fin- 
est black silk to cast this spell. This material 
component must be worth at least 100 gp 
and is used up during spellcasting. 


Wall of Fire (Evocation) 


Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The wall of fire spell brings forth an 
immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of 
shimmering color—violet or reddish-blue. 
The spell creates either an opaque sheet of 
flame up to one 20-foot square per level of 
the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up 
to 10 feet + five feet per two levels of expe- 
rience of the wizard. In either form, the wall 
of fire is 20 feet high. 

The wall of fire must be cast so that it is 
vertical with respect to the caster. One side 
of the wall, selected by the caster, sends 
forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of 
damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 
1d4 points of damage upon those within 20 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 2d6 points 
of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level 
of the spelicaster, upon any creature passing 
through it. Creatures especially subject to 
fire may take additional damage, and 
undead always take twice normal damage. 
Note that attempting to catch a moving 
creature with a newly-created wall of fire is 
difficult; a successful saving throw enables 
the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate 
and direction of movement determine 
which side of the created wall it is on. The 
wall of fire lasts as long as the wizard con- 
centrates on maintaining it, or one round 
per level of experience of the wizard, in the 
event he does not wish to concentrate upon 
it. 

The material component of the spell is 
phosphorus. 


Wall of Ice (Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell can be cast in one of three 
ways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a 
hemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall 
upon creatures with the effect of an ice 
storm. 

A) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a 
sheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall 
is primarily defensive, stopping pursuers 
and the like. The wall is one inch thick per 
level of experience of the wizard. It covers a 
10-foot-square area per level (a 10th-level 
wizard can create a wall of ice up to 100 feet 
long and 10 feet high or 50 feet long and 20 
feet high, etc.). Any creature breaking 
through the ice suffers 2 points of damage 
per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using 
creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, 
while cold-using creatures suffer only 1 
point of damage per inch when breaking 
through. The plane can be oriented in any 
fashion as long as it is anchored along one or 
more sides, 

B) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell 
creates a hemisphere whose maximum radi- 
us is equal to three feet plus one foot per 
caster level. Thus a 7th-level caster can cre- 
ate a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemi- 
sphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or 
melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, 
to trap mobile opponents under the hemi- 
sphere. 

C) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell 
causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon oppo- 
nents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square 
area per caster level. The sheet has the same 
effect as an ice storm's hail stones—3d10 
points of damage inflicted to creatures 
beneath it. 


A wall of ice cannot form in an area occu- 
pied by physical objects or creatures; its sur- 
face must be smooth and unbroken when 
created. Magical fires such as fireballs and 
fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one 
round, though this creates a great cloud of 
steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires 
or lesser magical ones do not hasten the 
melting of a wall of ice. 

The material component of this spell is a 
small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal. 


Wizard Eye (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is employed, the wizard 
creates an invisible sensory organ that sends 
him visual information. The wizard eye 
travels at 30 feet per round if viewing an 
area ahead as a human would (i.e., primari- 
ly looking at the floor), or 10 feet per round 
if examining the ceiling and walls as well as 
the floor ahead. The wizard eye can see with 
infravision up to 10 feet, and with normal 
vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit 
areas. The wizard eye can travel in any 
direction as as long as the spell lasts. It has 
substance and a form that can be detected 
(by a detect invisibility spell, for instance). 
Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wiz- 
ard eye, although it can pass through a 
space no smaller than a small mouse hole 
(one inch in diameter). 

Using the eye requires the wizard to con- 
centrate. However, if his concentration is 
broken the spell does not end—the eye 
merely becomes inert until the wizard again 
concentrates, subject to the duration of the 
spell. The powers of the eye cannot be 
enhanced by other spells or items. The cast- 
er is subject to any gaze attack met by the 
eye. A successful dispel cast on the wizard 
or eye ends the spell. With respect to blind- 
ness, magical darkness, and so on, the wiz- 
ard eye is considered an independent sen- 
sory organ of the caster. 

The material component of the spell is a 
bit of bat fur.

Advanced Illusion (Ilusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: One 40-foot cube + 
a 10-foot cube/level 

Saving Throw: Special 

This spell is essentially a spectral forces 
spell that operates through a program (simi- 
lar to a programmed illusion spell) deter- 
mined by the caster. It is thus unnecessary 
for the wizard to concentrate on the spell for 
longer than the round of casting it, as the 
program has then started and will continue 
without supervision. The illusion has vis- 
ual, audio, olfactory, and thermal compo- 
nents. If any viewer actively attempts to 
disbelieve the spell, he gains a saving throw 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


vs. spell. If any viewer successfully disbe- 
lieves and communicates this fact to other 
viewers, each such viewer gains a saving 
throw vs. spell with a +4 bonus. 

The material components are a bit of 
fleece and several grains of sand. 


Alry Water (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 10’ radius sphere or 
15’ radius hemisphere 

Saving Throw: None 


The airy water spell turns normal liquid, 
such as water or water-based solutions, into 
a less dense, breathable substance. Thus, if 
the wizard wanted to enter an underwater 
place, he would step into the water, cast the 
spell and sink downward in a globe of bub- 
bling water. He and any companions in the 
spell’s area of effect can move freely and 
breathe just as if the bubbling water were 
air. The globe is centered on and moves with 
the caster. Water-breathing creatures avoid 
a sphere (or hemisphere) of airy water, al- 
though intelligent ones can enter it if they 
are able to move by means other than swim- 
ming. No water-breathers can breathe in an 
area affected by this spell. There is only one 
word that needs to be spoken to actuate the 
magic, thus it can be cast underwater. The 
spell does not filter or remove solid particles 
of matter. 

The material component of the spell is a 
small handful of alkaline or bromine salts. 


Animal Growth (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Up to 8 animals in a 20’ cube 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard causes 
all designated animals, up to a maximum of 
eight, within a 20-foot-square area to grow 
to twice their normal size. The effects of this 
growth are doubled Hit Dice (with improve- 
ment in attack rolls) and doubled damage in 
combat. The spell lasts for one round for 
each level of experience of the wizard cast- 
ing the spell. Only natural animals, includ- 
ing giant forms, can be affected by this spell. 

The reverse, shrink animal, reduces ani- 
mal size by half and likewise reduces Hit 
Dice, attack damage, etc. 

The component of both versions of the 
spell is a pinch of powdered bone. 


Animate Dead (Necromancy) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 5 rounds 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell creates the lowest of the undead 
monsters—skeletons or zombies—usually 
from the bones or bodies of dead humans, 
demihumans, or humanoids. The spell 
causes existing remains to become animated 
and obey the simple verbal commands of 
the caster. The skeletons or zombies can fol- 
low the caster, remain in an area and attack 
any creature (or just a specific type of crea- 
ture) entering the place, etc. The undead re- 
main animated until they are destroyed in 
combat or are turned; the magic cannot be 
dispelled. The following types of dead crea- 
tures can be animated: 

A) Humans, demihumans, and human- 
oids with 1 Hit Die. The wizard can animate 
one skeleton for each experience level he has 
attained, or one zombie for every two 
levels. The experience levels, if any, of the 
slain are ignored; the body of a newly dead 
9th-level fighter is animated as a zombie 
with 2 Hit Dice, without special class or ra- 
cial abilities. 

B) Creatures with more than 1 Hit Die. 
The number of undead animated is deter- 
mined by the monster Hit Dice (the total Hit 
Dice cannot exceed the wizard’s level). Skel- 
etal forms have the Hit Dice of the original 
creature, while zombie forms have one 
more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard 
could animate four zombie gnolls (4 x [2 + 
1 Hit Dice] = 12), ora single fire giant skele- 
ton. Such undead have none of the special 
abilities they had in life. 

C) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The 
caster can animate two skeletons per level 
or one zombie per level. The creatures have 
their normal Hit Dice as skeletons and an 
additional Hit Die as zombies. Clerics re- 
ceive a +1 bonus when trying to turn these. 

This spell assumes that the bodies or 
bones are available and are reasonably in- 
tact (those of skeletons or zombies de- 
stroyed in combat won't be!). 

It requires a drop of blood and a pinch of 
bone powder or a bone shard to complete 
the spell. The casting of this spell is not a 
good act and only evil wizards use it fre- 
quently.

Avoidance (Abjuration, Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent until dispelled 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Up to 3-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


By means of this spell, the caster sets up a 
natural repulsion between the affected ob- 
ject and all other living things except him- 
self, Thus any living creature attempting to 
touch the affected object is repulsed (unable 
to come closer than one foot), or repulses 
the affected object, depending on the rela- 
tive mass of the two (a halfling attempting 
to touch an iron chest with an avoidance 
spell upon it will be thrown back, while the 
chest will skitter away from a giant-sized 
creature as the creature approaches). 

The material component for the spell is a 
magnetized needle. The spell cannot be cast 
upon living things; any attempt to cast 
avoidance upon the apparel or possessions 
of a living creature entitles the subject crea- 
ture to a saving throw vs. spell. 

The reverse of this spell, attraction, uses 
the same material components and sets up a 
natural attraction between the affected ob- 
ject and all living things. A creature is 
drawn to the object if the creature is smaller, 
or the object slides toward the creature if the 
creature is larger. A successful bend bars roll 
must be rolled to remove the enchanted ob- 
ject once it has adhered to an object or crea- 
ture. 


Bigby’s Interposing Hand (Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


Bigby’s interposing hand is a man-sized to 
gargantuan-sized magical hand that appears 
between the spellcaster and his chosen op- 
ponent. This disembodied hand then moves 
to remain between the two, regardless of 
what the spellcaster does or how the oppo- 
nent tries to get around it. Neither invisibil- 
ity nor polymorph fools the hand once a 
creature has been chosen. The hand does 
not pursue an opponent, nor does it move 
more than ten feet away from the caster. 

The size of the hand is determined by the 
wizard, and it can be human-sized (five feet) 
all the way up to titan-sized (25 feet). It pro- 
vides cover for the caster against the se- 
lected opponent, with all the attendant 
combat adjustments. It has as many hit 
points as the caster in full health and has an 
Armor Class of 0. 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


Any creature weighing less than 2,000 
pounds trying to push past it is slowed to 7/2 
normal movement. If the original opponent 
is slain, the caster can designate a new oppo- 
nent for the hand. The caster can command 
the hand out of existence at any time. 

The material component of the spell is a 
soft glove. 


Chaos (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Up to.40-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell is similar to the 4th-level confu- 
sion spell, but only the following beings 
receive a saving throw: fighters, wizards 
specialized in enchantments, monsters that 
use no magic and have an Intelligence of 4 or 
less, creatures of 21 Intelligence or higher, 
and creatures with more levels or Hit Dice 
than the caster’s level. 

The spell causes disorientation and severe 
perceptual distortion, creating indecision 
and the inability to take effective action. 
The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one 
creature per caster level. Those allowed sav- 
ing throws roll them vs. spell with —2 pen- 
alties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those who 
successfully save are unaffected by the spell. 
Affected creatures react as follows: 


D10 Roll Action 

1 Wander away (unless prevented) 
for duration of spell 

2-6 Stand confused one round 
(then roll again) 

7-9 Attack nearest creature for one 
round (then roll again) 

10 Act normally for one round 
(then roll again) 


The spell lasts one round for each level of 
the caster. Those affected are checked by the 
DM for actions each round for the duration 
of the spell, or until the “wander away for 
the duration of the spell” result occurs. 

Wandering creatures move as far from the 
caster as possible using their most typical 
mode of movement (characters walk, fish 
swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and 
actions are checked at the beginning of each 
round. Any confused creature that is 
attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy 
and acts according to its basic nature. 

The material component for this spell is a 
small disc of bronze and a small rod of iron. 


Cloudkill (Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 40’ wide, 20’ high, 
20’ deep cloud 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell generates a billowing cloud of 
ghastly yellowish green vapors that is so 
toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 
4 + 1Hit Dice, cause creatures with 4 + 1to 
5 + 1 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poi- 
son with —4 penalties or be slain, and crea- 
tures up to 6 Hit Dice (inclusive) to roll 
unmodified saving throws vs. poison or be 
slain. Holding one’s breath has no effect on 
the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th 
level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud 
immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison 
damage each round while in the area of 
effect. 

The cloudkill moves away from the spell- 
caster at 10 feet per round, rolling along the 
surface of the ground. A moderate breeze 
causes it to alter course (roll for direction), 
but it does not move back toward its caster. 
A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, 
and a greater wind force prevents the use of 
the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse 
the cloud in two rounds. As the vapors are 
heavier than air, they sink to the lowest 
level of the land, even pour down den or 
sinkhole openings; thus the spell is ideal for 
slaying nests of giant ants, for example. It 
cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast 
underwater. 


Cone of Cold (Evocation) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: 1/2 


When this spell is cast, it causes a cone- 
shaped area of extreme cold, originating at 
the wizard’s hand and extending outward in 
a cone five feet long and one foot in diame- 
ter per level of the caster. It drains heat and 
causes 1d4 + 1 points of damage per level of 
experience of the wizard. For example, a 
10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold 
10 feet in diameter and 50 feet long, causing 
10d4 + 10 points of damage. 

Its material component is a crystal or 
glass cone of very small size.

Conjure Elemental 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


There are actually four spells in the con- 
jure elemental spell. The wizard is able to 
conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemen- 
tal with this spell—assuming he has the 
material component for the particular ele- 
mental. (A considerable fire source must be 
in range to conjure a fire elemental; a large 
amount of water must be available to con- 
jure a water elemental.) Conjured elemen- 
tals have 8 Hit Dice. 

It is possible to conjure up successive ele- 
mentals of different types if the spellcaster 
has memorized two or more of these spells. 
The type of elemental to be conjured must 
be decided upon before memorizing the 
spell. Each type of elemental can be con- 
jured only once per day. 

The elemental conjured up must be con- 
trolled by the wizard—the spellcaster must 
concentrate on the elemental doing his 
commands—or it turns on the wizard and 
attacks. The elemental will not break off a 
combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures 
while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is 
wounded or grappled, his concentration is 
broken. There is always a 5% chance that 
the elemental turns on its conjurer regard- 
less of concentration. This check is made at 
the end of the second and each succeeding 
round. An elemental that breaks free of its 
control can be dispelled by the caster, but 
the chance of success is only 50%. The ele- 
mental can be controlled up to 30 yards 
away per level of the spellcaster. The ele- 
mental remains until its form on this plane is 
destroyed due to damage or until the spell’s 
duration expires. Note that water elemen- 
tals are destroyed if they are ever more than 
60 yards from a large body of water. 

The material component of the spell 
(besides the quantity of the element at hand) 
is a small amount of one of the following: 
Air Elemental—burning incense 
Earth Elemental—soft clay 
Fire Elemental—sulphur and phosphorus 
Water Elemental—water and sand 


Special protection from uncontrolled ele- 
mentals is available by means of a protec- 
tion from evil spell. 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


Contact Other Plane (Divination) 


Range: 0 
Components: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard sends 
his mind to another plane of existence in 
order to receive advice and information 
from powers there. As these powers resent 
such contact, only brief answers are given. 
(The DM answers all questions with “yes,” 
“no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” etc.) 
Any questions asked are answered by the 
power during the spell’s duration. The char- 
acter can contact an elemental plane or 
some plane farther removed. For every two 
levels of experience of the wizard, one ques- 
tion may be asked. Contact with minds far 
removed from the plane of the wizard 
increases the probability of the spellcaster 
going insane or dying, but the chance of the 
power knowing the answer, as well as the 
probability of the being telling the correct 
answer, are likewise increased by moving to 
distant planes. Once the outer planes are 
reached, the Intelligence of the power con- 
tacted determines the effects. 

The random table given here is subject to 
DM changes, development of extraplanar 
NPC beings, and so on. 

If insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the 
first question is asked. This condition lasts 
for one week for each removal of the plane 
contacted (see the DMG or Manual of the 
Planes), to a maximum of ten weeks. There 
is a 1% chance per plane that the wizard dies 
before recovering, unless a remove curse 
spell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard 
can recall the answer to the question. 

On rare occasions, this divination may be 
alocked by the action of certain lesser or 
sreater powers. 


Optionally, the DM may allow a spe- 
cific outer plane to be contacted (see 


Manual of the Planes); in this case, the 
difference 


in alignment between the cast- 

er and the plane contacted alters the 
maximum Intelligence that can be 
con’ difference in moral or 
ethical lowers the maximum 
that can be contacted by 1 

(e.g., an 18th-level good caster 


: lawful 
could contact the plane of the Sev 
Heavens (LG) on the “Intelligence 20” 
line, or the plane of Elysium (NG) on the 
“Intelligence 19” line), 


Demi-Shadow Monsters 
(INusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell is similar to the 4th-level spell, 
shadow monsters, except that the monsters 
created are effectively 40% of normal hit 
points. If the saving throw is made, their 
damage potential is only 40% of normal 
and their Armor Class is 8. The monsters 
have none of the special abilities of the real 
creatures, although victims may be deluded 
into believing this to be so.

Dismissal (Abjuration) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell, a wizard on the 
Prime Material plane seeks to force or to 
enable a creature from another plane of 
existence to return to its proper plane. Mag- 
ic resistance, if any, is checked if this spell is 
used to force a being home. If the resistance 
fails, the caster’s level is compared to the 
creature's level or Hit Dice. If the wizard’s 
level is higher, the difference is subtracted 
from the creature's die roll for its saving 
throw vs. spell. If the creature's level or Hit 
Dice is higher, the difference is added to the 
saving throw roll. 

If the creature desires to be returned to its 
home plane, no saving throw is necessary (it 
chooses to fail the roll). 

If the spell is successful, the creature is 
instantly whisked away, but the spell has a 
20% chance of actually sending the subject 
to a plane other than its own. 

The material component is any item that 
is distasteful to the subject creature. 


Distance Distortion (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 turns/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: One 10-foot cube per level 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell can be cast only in an area com- 
pletely surrounded or enclosed by earth, 
rock, sand, or similar materials. The wizard 
must also cast a conjure elemental spell to 
summon an earth elemental. The elemental 
serves without attempting to break free 
when the spellcaster announces that his 
intent is to cast a distance distortion spell. 
The spell places the earth elemental in the 
area of effect, and the elemental then causes 
the area’s dimensions to be either doubled or 
halved for those traveling over it (spellcast- 
er's choice of which). Thus a 10’ X 100’ cor- 
ridor could seem to be either five feet wide 
and 50 feet long or 20 feet wide and 200 feet 
long. When the spell duration has elapsed, 
the elemental returns to its own plane. 

The true nature of an area affected by dis- 
tance distortion is undetectable to any crea- 
ture traveling along it, but the area dimly 
radiates magic, and a true seeing spell can 
reveal that an earth elemental is spread 
within the area. 

The material needed for this spell is a 
small lump of soft clay. 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


Domination (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The domination spell enables the caster to 
control the actions of any person until the 
spell is ended by the subject's Intelligence 
(see the charm person spell). Elves and half- 
elves resist this enchantment as they do all 
charm-type spells. When the spell is cast, 
the subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell 
at a penalty of —2, but Wisdom adjust- 
ments apply. Failure means the wizard has 
established a telepathic link with the sub- 
ject’s mind. If a common language is shared, 
the wizard can generally force the subject to 
perform as the wizard desires, within the 
limits of the subject’s body structure and 
Strength. Note that the caster does not re- 
ceive direct sensory input from the subject. 

Subjects resist this control, and those 
forced to take actions against their natures 
receive a new saving throw with a bonus of 
+1 to +4, depending on the type of action 
required. Obviously self-destructive orders 
are not carried out. Once control is estab- 
lished, there is no limit to the range at which 
it can be exercised, as long as the caster and 
subject are on the same plane. 

A protection from evil spell can prevent 
the caster from exercising control or using 
the telepathic link while the subject is so 
warded, but it cannot prevent the establish- 
ment of domination. 


Dream (Invocation, Illusion/Phantasm) 
Reversible 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


The dream spell enables the caster, or a 
messenger touched by the caster, to send 
messages to others in the form of dreams. At 
the beginning of the spell, the caster must 
name the recipient or identify him by some 
title that leaves no doubt as to his identity. 

As the caster completes the spell, the per- 
son sending the spell falls into a deep trance- 
like sleep, and instantaneously projects his 
mind to the recipient. The sender then en- 
ters the recipient's dream and delivers the 
message unless the recipient is magically 
protected. If the recipient is awake, the mes- 
sage sender can choose to remain in the 
trance-like sleep. If the sender is disturbed 
during this time, the spell is immediately 
cancelled and the sender comes out of the 


trance. The whereabouts and current activi- 
ties of the recipient cannot be learned 
through this spell. 

The sender is unaware of his own sur- 
roundings or the activities around him while 
he is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, 
both physically and mentally (i.e., he al- 
ways fails any saving throw) while in the 
trance. 

Once the recipient's dreams are entered, 
the sender can deliver a message of any 
length, which the recipient remembers per- 
fectly upon waking. The communication is 
one-way, the recipient cannot ask questions 
or offer information. Nor can the sender 
gain any information by observing the 
dreams of the recipient. Once the message is 
delivered, the sender's mind returns in- 
stantly to his body. The duration of the spell 
is the time required for the sender to enter 
the recipient's dream and deliver the mes- 
sage. 

The reverse of this spell, nightmare, en- 
ables the caster to send a hideous and unset- 
tling vision to the recipient, who is allowed 
a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. 
The nightmare prevents restful sleep and 
causes 1d10 hit points of damage. The 
nightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and 
unable to regain spells for the next day. A 
dispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns 
the caster of the nightmare for one turn per 
level of the cleric countering this evil send- 
ing. 


Extension Il (Alteration) 


Range: 0 
Components; V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell is the same as the 4th-level ex- 
tension I spell, except it extends the duration 
of 1st- through 4th-level spells by 50%. 


Fabricate (Enchantment, Alteration) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: Special 

Area of Effect: 1 cubic yd./level 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard is able 
to convert material of one sort into a 
product that is of the same material. Thus 
the spellcaster can fabricate a wooden 
bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a 
patch of hemp, clothes from flax or wool, 
and so forth. Magical or living things can- 
not be created or altered by a fabricate spell. 
The quality of items made by this spell is 
commensurate with the quality of material 
used as the basis for the new fabrication. If a 


mineral is worked with, the area of effect is 
reduced by a factor of 27—one cubic foot 
per level instead of one cubic yard. 

Articles requiring a high degree of crafts- 
manship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, 
etc.) cannot be fabricated unless the wizard 
otherwise has great skill in the appropriate 
craft. 

Casting requires one full round per cubic 
yard (or foot) or material to be affected by 
the spell. 


False Vision (Divination) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 

Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard is able 
to confound any attempt to scry (by means 
of either a spell or a magical device) any 
point within the area of effect of the spell. To 
use the spell, he must be aware of the scry- 
ing attempt, although knowledge of the 
scryer or the scryer’s location is not neces- 
sary. Upon casting the spell, the caster and 
all he desires within the radius of the spell 
become undetectable to the scrying. Fur- 
thermore, the caster is able to send what- 
ever message he desires, including vision 
and sound, according to the medium of the 
scrying method, To do this, the caster must 
concentrate on the message he is sending. 
Once concentration is broken, no further 
images can be sent, although the caster re- 
mains undetectable for the duration of the 
spell. 

The material component for this spell is 
the ground dust of an emerald worth at least 
500 gp, which is sprinkled into the air when 
the spell is cast. 


Feeblemind (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell is used solely against people or 
creatures who use magic spells. Feeblemind 
causes the subject's intellect to degenerate to 
that of a moronic child. The subject remains 
in this state until a heal or wish spell is used 
to cancel the effects. Magic-using beings are 
very vulnerable to this spell, thus their sav- 
ing throws-suffer the following penalties: 


Saving Throw 


Spell Use of Target Adjustment 
Priest +1 
Wizard (human) -4 
Combination or nonhuman =2 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


Wisdom adjustments apply to the saving 
throw. 

The material component of this spell is a 
handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral 
spheres, which disappears when the spell is 
cast. 


Hold Monster (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 5 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 to 4 creatures in a 
40-foot cube 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell immobilizes from one to four 
creatures of any type within spell range and 
in sight of the spellcaster. He can opt to hold 
one, two, three, or four creatures. If three or 
four are attacked, each saving throw is nor- 
mal; if two are attacked, each saving throw 
suffers a —1 penalty; if only one is attacked, 
the saving throw suffers a —3 penalty. 

The material component for this spell is 
one hard metal bar or rod for each monster 
to be held. The bar or rod can be as small as 
a three-penny nail. 


Leomund’s Lamentable 
Belaborment (Enchantment, Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 10- 
foot radius 

Saving Throw: Special 


This devious spell distracts the subject 
creatures by drawing them into an absorb- 
ing discussion on topics of interest to them. 
A chain of responses occurs during the next 
11 rounds, with additional saving throws as 
described later. These responses are conver- 
sation (rounds 1-3), possible confusion 
(rounds 4-6), then either rage or lamenta- 
tion (rounds 7-11). All saving throws are 
affected by the creatures’ Intelligences, as 
noted later. The subject creatures must be 
able to understand the language in which 
the spellcaster speaks. 

Upon casting the spell, the wizard begins 
discussion of some topic germane to the 
creature or creatures to be affected. Those 
making a successful saving throw vs. spell 
are unaffected. Affected creatures immedi- 
ately begin to converse with the spellcaster, 
agreeing or disagreeing, all most politely. As 
long as the spellcaster chooses, he can main- 
tain the spell by conversing with the sub- 
ject(s). If the caster is attacked or otherwise 
distracted, the subject creatures do not 
notice. 


Intelligence Saving Throw Modifier 
2 or less Spell has no effect 
3to7 Hs 

8 to 10 0 

11 to 14 +1 

15 or higher +2 


The wizard can leave at any time after the 
casting and the subject(s) continue on as if 
the caster were still present. As long as they 
are not attacked, the creatures ignore all else 
going on around them, spending their time 
talking and arguing to the exclusion of other 
activities. However, when the caster leaves, 
each subject completes only the stage of the 
spell that it is currently in, and then the spell 
is broken. 

If the caster maintains the spell for more 
than three rounds, each affected creature 
can roll another saving throw vs. spell. 
Those failing to save wander off in confu- 
sion for 1d10 + 2 rounds, staying away 
from the spellcaster. Those who make this 
saving throw continue to talk and roll sav- 
ing throws each round the caster continues 
the spell, up through the sixth round, to 
avoid the confusion effect. 

If the spell is maintained for more than six 
rounds, each subject must roll a successful 
saving throw vs. spell to avoid going into a 
rage, attacking all other subjects of the spell 
with intent to kill. This rage lasts for 1d4 + 1 
rounds. Those who successfully save 
against the rage effect realize that they have 
been deceived and collapse to the ground, 
lamenting their foolishness, for 1d4 rounds 
unless attacked or otherwise disturbed. 


Leomund’s Secret Chest 
(Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: Special 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 60 days 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: 1 chest of about 
2' X 2' X 3' size 

Saving Throw: None 

This spell enables a specially constructed 
chest to be hidden deep within the Ethereal 
plane, to be summoned using a small model 
of the chest. The large chest must be excep- 
tionally well-crafted and expensive, con- 
structed for the caster by master craftsmen. 
If made principally of wood, it must be ebo- 
ny, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the 
like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and 
hardware must be platinum. If constructed 
of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must 
be gold. If the chest is fashioned from 
bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be 
electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is 
never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is con- 
structed, the wizard must havea tiny replica 
(of the same materials and perfect in every 
detail) made, so that the miniature of the 
chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wiz- 


169 


ard can have but one pair of these chests at 
any given time—even wish spells do not 
allow exceptions! The chests themselves are 
nonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, 
wards, and so on just as any normal chest. 

While touching the chest and holding the 
tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This 
causes the large chest to vanish into the 
Ethereal plane. The chest can contain one 
cubic foot of material per level of the wizard 
no matter what its apparent size. Living 
matter makes it 75% likely that the spell 
fails, so the chest is typically used for secur- 
ing valuable spell books, magical items, 
gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the 
small duplicate of the magical chest, he can 
recall the large one from the Ethereal plane 
whenever the chest is desired. If the minia- 
ture of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is 
no way, not even a wish spell, that the large 
chest can return, although an expedition 
might be mounted to find it. 

While the chest is in the Ethereal plane, 
there is a 1% cumulative chance per week 
that some being finds it. This chance is reset 
to 1% whenever the chest is recalled and the 
spell recast to return it to the Ethereal plane. 
If the chest is found, the DM must work out 
the encounter and decide how the being 
reacts to the chest (for example, it might 
ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, 
or even exchange or add to the items 
present!). 

Whenever the secret chest is brought back 
to the Prime Material plane, an ethereal 
window is opened and for a variable 
amount of time, usually about one turn, 
slowly diminishes in size. When this hole 
opens between the planes, check for an ethe- 
real encounter to see if a monster is drawn 
through. 

If the large chest is not retrieved before 
the spell duration lapses, there is a cumula- 
tive chance of 5% per day that the chest is 
lost. 


Magic Jar (Necromancy) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 


The magic jar spell enables the caster to 
shift his life force into a special receptacle (a 
gem or large crystal). From there the caster 
can force an exchange of life forces between 
the receptacle and another creature, thus 
enabling the wizard to take over and control 
the body of another creature, while the life 
force of the host is confined in the recepta- 
cle. The special life force receptacle must be 
within spell range of the wizard’s body at 
the time of spellcasting. The wizard’s life 
force shifts into the receptacle in the round 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


in which the casting is completed, allowing 
no other actions. 

While in the magic jar, the caster can 
sense and attack any life force within a 10- 
foot-per-level radius (on the same plane); 
however, the exact creature types and rela- 
tive physical positions cannot be deter- 
mined. In a group of life forces, the caster 
can sense a difference of four or more 
levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether 
a life force is positive or negative energy. For 
example, if two 10th-level fighters are 
attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the 
caster could determine that there are three 
stronger and four weaker life forces within 
range, all with positive life energy. The cast- 
er could try to take over either a stronger or 
a weaker creature, but he has no control 
over exactly which creature is attacked. 

An attempt to take over a host body 
requires a full round. It is blocked by a pro- 
tection from evil spell or similar ward. It is 
successful only if the subject fails a saving 
throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see 
following). The saving throw is modified by 
subtracting the combined Intelligence and 
Wisdom scores of the target from those of 
the wizard (Intelligence and hit dice in non- 
human or nonhumanoid creatures). This 
modifier is added to (or subtracted from) 
the die roll. 

Die Adjustment 
+4 
+3 
+2 


e x i rd” 
rel ew Oe a ‘ a) 
> a . 
> re : 
4 ‘ J 


+13 or more =3 


A negative score indicates that the wizard 
has a lower total than the target, thus the 
host has a saving throw bonus. Failure to 
take over the host leaves the wizards life 
force in the magic jar. 

If successful, the caster’s life force occu- 
pies the host body and the host's life force is 
confined in the magic jar receptacle. The 
caster can call upon rudimentary or instinc- 
tive knowledge of the subject creature, but 
not upon its real or acquired knowledge 
{i.e., the wizard does not automatically 
know the language or spells of the creature). 
The caster retains his own attack rolls, class 
knowledge and training, and any adjust- 
ments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If 
the host body is human or humanoid, and 
the necessary spell components are availa- 
ble, the wizard can even use his memorized 
spells. The host body retains its own hit 
points and physical abilities and properties. 
The DM decides if any additional modifica- 
tions are necessary; for example, perhaps 
clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the cast- 
er must become used to the new form. The 
alignment of the host or receptacle is that of 


the occupying life force. 

The caster can shift freely from the host to 
the receptacle if within the 10-feet/level 
range. Each attempt to shift requires one 
round. The spell ends when the wizard 
shifts from the jar to his own body. 

A successful dispel magic spell cast on the 
host can drive the caster of the magic jar 
spell back into the receptacle and prevent 
him from making any attacks for 1d4 
rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of 
the dispel. The base success chance is 50%, 
+/-— 5% per level difference between the 
casters. A successful dispel magic cast 
against the receptacle forces the occupant 
back into his own body. If the wizard who 
cast the magic jar is forced back into his own 
body, the spell ends. 

If the host body is slain, the caster returns 
to the receptacle, if within range, and the 
life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). 
If the host body is slain beyond the range of 
the spell, both the host and the caster die. 

Any life force with nowhere to go is treat- 
ed as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, 
resurrection, or similar spell. 

If the body of the caster is slain, his life 
force survives if it is in either the receptacle 
or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed 
while the caster’s life force occupies it, the 
caster is irrevocably slain. 


Major Creation (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


Like the minor creation spell, major crea- 
tion enables the wizard to pull wisps of 
material from the plane of Shadow to create 
an item of nonliving, vegetable nature—soft 
goods, rope, wood, etc. The wizard can also 
create mineral objects—stone, crystal, 
metal, etc. The item created cannot exceed 
one cubic foot per level of the spellcaster in 
volume. The duration of the created item 
varies with its relative hardness and rarity: 


Vegetable matter 2 hours/level 


Stone or crystal 1 hour/level 
Precious metals 2 turns/level 
Gems 1 turn/level 
Mithral * 2 rounds/level 
Adamantite 1 round/level 


* Includes similar rare metals. 


Attempting to use any of these as material 
components in a spell will cause the spell to 
fail. The spellcaster must have at least a tiny 
piece of matter of the same type as the item 
he plans to create—a bit of twisted hemp to 
create rope, a chip of stone to create a boul- 
der, and so on.

Monster Summoning III 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 50 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- 
ster summoning I spell, except that this spell 
summons 1d4 3rd-level monsters. These 
appear within spell range and attack the 
caster’s opponents, until either he com- 
mands them to cease, the spell duration 
expires, or the monsters are slain. These 
creatures do not check morale and vanish 
when slain. If no opponent exists to fight, 
and the wizard can communicate with 
them, the summoned monsters can perform 
other services for the wizard. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny bag and a small candle. 


Mordenkainen’s Faithful Hound 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard sum- 
mons up a phantom watchdog that only he 
can see. He may then command it to per- 
form as guardian of a passage, room, door, 
or similar space or portal. The phantom 
watchdog immediately commences a loud 
barking if any creature larger than a cat 
approaches the place it guards. As the faith- 
ful hound is able to detect invisible creatures 
and ward against the approach of ethereal 
creatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does 
not react to illusions that are not at least 
quasi-real. 

If the intruding creature exposes its back 
to the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious 
attack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, 
striking for 3d6 points of damage. It is able 
to hit opponents of all types, even those 
normally subject only to magical weapons 
of +3 or greater. Creatures without backs 
are not attacked (ochre jellies, for instance). 
The faithful hound cannot be attacked, but 
it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maxi- 
mum of one hour plus ?/2 hour per caster 
level, but once it is activated by an intruder, 
it lasts only one round per caster level. If the 
spellcaster is ever more than 30 yards dis- 
tant from the area that the watchdog 
guards, the spell ends. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a 
thread. 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


Passwall (Alteration) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


A passwall spell enables the spellcaster to 
open a passage through wooden, plaster, or 
stone walls, but not other materials. The 
spellcaster and any associates can simply 
walk through. The spell causes a 5’ wide X 
8' high X 10’ deep opening. Several of these 
spells can form a continuing passage so that 
very thick walls can be pierced. If dispelled, 
the passwall closes away from the dispelling 
caster, ejecting those in the passage. 

The material component of this spell is a 
pinch of sesame seeds. 


Seeming (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10-foot radius 
Components: V, S 

Duration: 12 hours 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 person/2 levels 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to alter the 
appearance of one person for every two 
levels of experience he has attained. The 
change includes clothing and equipment. 
The caster can make the recipients appear as 
any generally man-shaped bipedal creature, 
each up to one foot shorter or taller than his 
normal height, and thin or fat or in 
between. All those affected must resemble 
the same general type of creature: human, 
orc, ogre, etc. Each remains a recognizable 
individual. The effect fails for an individual 
if the illusion chosen by the caster cannot be 
accomplished within the spell parameters 
(for example, a halfling could not be made 
to look like a centaur, but he might be made 
to look like a short, young ogre). Unwilling 
persons receive saving throws vs. spell to 
avoid the effect. Affected persons resume 
their normal appearances if slain. The spell 
is not precise enough to duplicate the 
appearance of a specific individual. 


Sending (Evocation) 


Range: Special 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster can con- 
tact a single creature with whom he is famil- 
iar and whose name and appearance are 
known. If the creature in question is not on 
the same plane of existence as the spellcast- 


er, there is a base 5% chance that the send- 
ing does not arrive. Local conditions on oth- 
er planes may worsen this chance 
considerably at the option of the DM. The 
sending, if successful, can be understood 
even by a creature with an Intelligence as 
low as 1 (animal Intelligence). 

The wizard can send a short message of 25 
words or less to the recipient. Also the recip- 
ient can answer in like manner immediately. 
Even if the sending is received, the subject 
creature is not obligated to act upon it in 
any manner. 

The material component for this spell 
consists of two tiny cylinders, each with one 
open end, connected by a short piece of fine 
copper wire. 


Shadow Door (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard creates 
the illusion of a door. The illusion also per- 
mits the wizard to appear to step through 
this “door” and disappear. In reality he has 
darted aside and can flee, totally invisible, 
for the spell duration. Creatures viewing 
this are deluded into seeing or entering an 
empty 10’ X 10' room if they open the 
“door.” A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, 
or similar magical means can discover the 
wizard. Certain high Hit Dice monsters 
might also notice the wizard (see the invisi- 
bility spell), but only if making an active 
attempt to do so. 


Shadow Magic (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 50 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: Special 


The shadow magic spell enables the wiz- 
ard to tap energy from the Shadow plane to 
cast a quasi-real wizard evocation spell of 
3rd level or less. For example, this spell can 
be magic missile, fireball, lightning bolt, or 
so on, and has normal effects upon crea- 
tures in the area of effect if they fail their 
saving throws vs. spell. Thus a creature fail- 
ing to save against a shadow magic fireball 
must roll another saving throw, suffering 
half of the normal fireball damage if suc- 
cessful and full normal fireball damage if the 
saving throw is failed. If the first saving 
throw was successful, the shadow magic 
nature is detected and only 20% of the 
rolled damage is received (rounding down 
below fractions below .4 and rounding up 


171 


fractions of .4 and above). 


Stone Shape (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard can 
form an existing piece of stone into a shape 
that suits his purposes. For example, a stone 
weapon can be made, a special trapdoor 
fashioned, or an idol sculpted. This spell 
can also enable the spellcaster to reshape a 
stone door so as to escape imprisonment, 
providing the volume of stone involved was 
within the limits of the area of effect. While 
stone coffers can be thus formed and stone 
doors made, the fineness of detail is not 
great. If the construction involves small 
moving parts, there is a 30% chance they do 
not function. 

The material component of this spell is 
soft clay that must be worked into roughly 
the desired shape of the stone object and 
then touched to the stone when the spell is 
uttered. 


Summon Shadow 
(Conjuration/Summoning, Necromancy) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 10-foot cube 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard con- 
jures up one shadow (see the Monstrous 
Compendium) for every three levels of 
experience he has attained. These monsters 
are under the control of the spellcaster and 
attack his enemies on command. The 
shadows remain until slain, turned, or the 
spell duration expires. 

The material component for this spell is a 
bit of smoky quartz. 


Telekinesis (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell, the wizard is able 
to move objects by concentrating on mov- 
ing them mentally. The spell can provide 
either a gentle, sustained force or a single 
short, violent thrust. 

A sustained force enables the wizard to 
move a weight of up to 25 pounds a distance 


Wizard Spells (5th Level) 


up to 20 feet per round. The spell lasts two 
rounds, plus one round per caster level. The 
weight can be moved vertically, horizon- 
tally, or both. An object moved beyond the 
caster’s range falls or stops. If the caster 
ceases concentration for any reason, the ob- 
ject falls or stops. The object can be tele- 
kinetically manipulated as if with one hand. 
For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a 
key can be turned, an object rotated and so 
on, if the force required is within the weight 
limitation. The caster might even be able to 
untie simple knots, at the discretion of the 
DM. 

Alternatively, the spell energy can be ex- 
pended in a single round. The caster can 
hurl one or more objects within range, and 
within a ten-foot cube, directly away from 
himself at high speed, to a distance of up to 
ten feet per caster level. This is subject to a 
maximum weight of 25 pounds per caster 
level. Damage caused by hurled objects is 
decided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 
point of damage per caster level. Opponents 
who fall within the weight capacity of the 
spell can be hurled, but they are allowed a 
saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. 
Furthermore, those able to employ as simple 
a counter-measure as an enlarge spell, for 
example (thus making the body weight go 
over the maximum spell limit), can easily 
counter the spell. The various Bigby’s hand 
spells also counter this spell. 


Teleport (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is used, the wizard in- 
stantly transports himself, along with a cer- 
tain amount of additional weight that is on 
or being touched by the spellcaster, to a 
well-known destination. Distance is not a 
factor, but interplanar travel is not possible 
by means of a teleport spell. The spellcaster 
is able to teleport a maximum weight of 250 
pounds, plus an additional 150 pounds for 
each level of experience above the 10th (a 
13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700 
pounds). If the destination area is very fa- 
miliar to the wizard (he has a clear mental 
picture through actual proximity to and 
study of the area), it is unlikely that there is 
any error in arriving, although the caster 
has no control over his facing upon arrival. 
Lesser known areas (those seen only magi- 
cally or from a distance) increase the proba- 
bility of error. Unfamiliar areas present 
considerable peril (see table). 


Probability of 
Teleporting: 
On 

Destination Is: High Target Low 
Very familiar 01-02 03-99 00 
Studied carefully 01-04 05-98 99-00 
Seen casually 01-08 09-96 97-00 
Viewed once 01-16 17-92 93-00 
Never seen 01-32 33-84 85-00 


Teleporting high means the wizard arrives 
ten feet above the ground for every 1% he is 
below the lowest “On Target” probability; 
this could be as high as 320 feet if the desti- 
nation area was never seen. Any low result 
means the instant death of the wizard if the 
area into which he teleports is solid. A wiz- 
ard cannot teleport to an area of empty 
space—a substantial surface must be there, 
whether a wooden floor, a stone floor, natu- 
ral ground, etc. Areas of strong physical or 
magical energies may make teleportation 
more hazardous or even impossible. 


Transmute Rock to Mud (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: One 20-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell turns natural rock of any sort 
into an equal volume of mud. The depth of 
the mud can never exceed one-half its length 
or breadth. If it is cast upon a rock, for ex- 
ample, the rock affected collapses into mud. 
Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or other- 
wise free themselves from the mud sink at 
the rate of ten feet per round and suffocate, 
except for light-weight creatures that could 
normally pass across such ground. Brush 
thrown atop the mud can support creatures 
able to climb on top of it, with the amount 
of brush required subject to the DM's discre- 
tion. The mud remains until a dispel magic 
spell or a reverse of this spell, mud to rock, 
restores its substance—but not necessarily 
its form. Evaporation turns the mud to nor- 
mal dirt, at the rate of 1d6 days per ten cubic 
feet. The mud to rock reverse can harden 
normal mud into soft stone (sandstone or 
similar mineral) permanently unless magi- 
cally changed. 

The material components for the spell are 
clay and water (or sand, lime, and water for 
the reverse).

Wall of Force (Evocation) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Up to 10-foot square/level 
Saving Throw: None 


A wall of force spell creates an invisible 
barrier in the locale desired by the caster, up 
to the spell’s range. The wall of force cannot 
move and is totally unaffected by most 
spells, including dispel magic. But a disinte- 
grate spell will immediately destroy it, as 
will a rod of cancellation or a sphere of anni- 
hilation. Likewise, the wall of force is not 
affected by blows, missiles, cold, heat, elec- 
tricity, etc. Spells and breath weapons can- 
not pass through it in either direction, 
although dimension door, teleport, and 
similar effects can bypass the barrier. 

The wizard can, if desired, form the wall 
into a spherical shape with a radius up to 
one foot per level or to an open hemispheri- 
cal shape of 1.5-foot radius per caster level. 
The wall of force must be continuous and 
unbroken when formed; if its surface is bro- 
ken by any object or creature, the spell fails. 
The caster can end the spell on command, 

The material component for this spell is a 
pinch of powdered diamond worth 5,000 
gp. 


Wall of tron (Evocation) 


Range: 5 yards/level . 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 15 square feet/level or 
special 

Saving Throw: None 


Wher this spell is cast, the wizard causes 
a vertical iron wall to spring into being. This 
wall can be used to seal off a passage or 
close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into 
any surrounding nonliving material if its 
area is sufficient to do so. The wall of iron is 
1/4 inch thick per level of experience of the 
spellcaster. The wizard is able to create an 
area of iron wall up to 15 square feet for 
each of his experience levels, so at 12th level 
a wall of iron 180 square feet in area can be 
created. The wizard can double the wall’s 
area by halving its thickness. 

If the caster desires, the wall can be cre- 
ated vertically resting on a flat surface, so 
that it can be tipped over, to fall on and 
crush any creature beneath it. The wall is 
50% likely to tip in either direction. This 
chance can be modified by a force of not less 
than 30 Strength and 400 pounds mass— 
each pound over 400 or Strength point over 
30 alters the chance by 1% in favor of the 
stronger side. Creatures with room to flee 
the falling wall may do so by making suc- 


Wizard Spells (6th Level) 


cessful saving throws vs. death. Those who 
fail are killed. Huge and gargantuan crea- 
tures cannot be crushed by the wall. 

The wall is permanent, unless success- 
fully dispelled, but it is subject to all forces a 
normal iron wall is subject to—rust, perfo- 
ration, etc. 

The material component of this spell is a 
small piece of sheet iron. 


Wall of Stone (Evocation) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell creates a wall of granite rock 
that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It 
is typically employed to close passages, por- 
tals, and breaches against opponents. The 
wall of stone is ?/a inch thick and up to 20 
square feet per level of experience of the 
wizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12th-level 
wizard can create a wall of stone three 
inches thick and up to 240 square feet in sur- 
face area (a 12-foot-wide and 20-foot-high 
wall, for example, to completely close a 10’ 
X 16’ passage). The wall created need not 
be vertical nor need it rest upon any firm 
foundation (see the wall of iron spell); how- 
ever, it must merge with and be'solidly sup- 
ported by existing stone. It can be used to 
bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. 
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, 
the wall must be arched and buttressed. 
This requirement reduces the area of effect 
by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create 
a span with a surface area of 200 square feet. 
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow 
crenelations, battlements, and so forth by 
likewise reducing the area. The stone is per- 
manent unless destroyed by a dispel magic 
spell or a disintegrate spell, or by normal 
means such as breaking or chipping. 

The material component is a small block 
of granite.

Sixth-Level Spells 


Anti-Magic Shell (Abjuration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1'/level diameter sphere 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard sur- 
rounds himself with an invisible barrier that 
moves with him. The area within this bar- 
rier is totally impervious to all magic and 
magical spell effects, thus preventing the 
passage of spells or their effects. Likewise it 
prevents the functioning of any magical 
items or spells within its confines. The area 
is also impervious to breath weapons, gaze 
or voice attacks, and similar special attack 
forms. 

The anti-magic shell also hedges out 
charmed, summoned, or conjured crea- 
tures. It cannot, however, be forced against 
any creature that it would keep at bay; any 
attempt to do creates a discernible pressure 
against the barrier, and continued pressure 
will break the spell. Normal creatures (a 
normally encountered troll rather than one 
conjured up, for instance) can enter the 
area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, 
while a magical sword does not function 
magically within the area, it is still a sword. 
Note that creatures on their home plane are 
normal creatures there. Thus on the elemen- 
tal plane of Fire, a randomly encountered 
fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this 
spell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of 


173 


demigod or higher status are unaffected by 
mortal magic such as this. 

Should the caster be larger than the area 
enclosed by the barrier, parts of his person 
may be considered exposed, at the referee's 
option. A dispel magic spell does not re- 
move the spell; the caster can end it upon 
command. 


Bigby’s Forceful Hand (Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


Bigby’s forceful hand is a more powerful 
version of Bigby’s interposing hand. It cre- 
ates a man-sized (five feet) to gargantuan- 
sized (21 feet) hand that places itself 
between the spellcaster and a chosen oppo- 
nent. This disembodied hand then moves to 
remain between the two, regardless of what 
the spellcaster does or how the opponent 
tries to get around it. However, the forceful 
hand also pushes on the opponent. This 
force can push away a creature weighing 
500 pounds or less, slow movement to 10 
feet per round if the creature weighs be- 
tween 500 and 2,000 pounds, or slow move- 
ment by 50% if the creature weighs more 
than 2,000 pounds. 

A creature pushed away is pushed to the 
range limit, or until pressed against an un- 
yielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no 
damage. The forceful hand has an Armor 
Class of 0, has as many hit points as its 
caster in full health, and vanishes when de- 
stroyed. The caster can cause it to retreat (to 
release a trapped opponent, for example) or 
dismiss it on command. 

The material component is a glove. 


Chain Lightning (Evocation) 


Range: 40 yards + 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: +/2 


This spell creates an electrical discharge 
that begins as a single stroke of lightning, 
21/2 feet wide, commencing from the finger- 
tips of the caster. Unlike a lightning bolt 
spell, chain lightning strikes one object or 
creature initially, then arcs to a series of 
other objects or creatures within range, los- 
ing energy with each jump. 

The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of 
damage per level of the caster, to a maxi- 
mum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or 
creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. 
spell). After the first strike, the lightning 
arcs to the next nearest object or creature. 


Wizard Spells (6th Level) 


Each jump reduces the strength of the light- 
ning by 1d6, Each creature or magical object 
hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success 
on this save indicates the creature suffers 
only half damage from the bolt. 

The chain can strike as many times (in- 
cluding the first object or creature) as the 
spell caster has levels, although each crea- 
ture or object can be struck only once. 
Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can 
strike up to 12 times, causing less damage 
with each strike. The bolt continues to arc 
until it has struck the appropriate number of 
objects or creatures, until it strikes an object 
that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of 
a large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, 
etc.), or until there are no more objects or 
creatures to strike. 

Direction is not a consideration when 
plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a 
factor—an arc cannot exceed the spell’s 
range. If the only possible arc is greater than 
the spell’s range, the stroke fades into noth- 
ingness. Creatures immune to electrical at- 
tack can be struck, even though no damage 
is taken. Note that it is possible for the chain 
to arc back to the caster! 

The material components are a bit of fur, 
a piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod, and 
one silver pin for each experience level of 
the caster. 


Conjure Animals 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The conjure animals spell enables the wiz- 
ard to magically create one or more mam- 
mals to attack his opponents. The total Hit 
Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice 
his level, if determined randomly, or his 
level if a specific animal type is requested 
(see the Dungeon Master's Guide). Thus, a 
wizard of 12th level could randomly conjure 
two mammals with 12 Hit Dice, four with 6 
Hit Dice each, six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight 
with 3 Hit Dice each, twelve with 2 Hit Dice 
each, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every 
+1 hit point bonus of a creature as */a of a 
Hit Die, thus a creature with 4+3 Hit Dice 
equals a 43/4 Hit Dice creature, The con- 
jured animal(s) remain for one round for 
each level of the conjuring wizard, or until 
slain. They follow the caster's verbal com- 
mands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack 
the wizard’s opponents, but they resist being 
used for any other purpose. 


Contingency (Evocation) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 day/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard is able 
to place another spell upon his person so 
that the latter spell will come into effect un- 
der the conditions dictated during the cast- 
ing of the contingency spell. The 
contingency spell and the spell it is to bring 
into effect are cast at the same time (the one- 
turn casting time indicated is the total for 
both castings). 

The spell to be brought into effect by the 
prescribed contingency must be one that af- 
fects the wizard’s person (feather fall, levita- 
tion, fly, feign death, etc.) and is of a spell 
level no higher than /3 of the caster’s experi- 
ence level (rounded down), but not higher 
than the 6th spell level. 


Caster Level Contingency Spell Level 
12th-14th 4th 
15th-17th Sth 
18th + 6th 


Only one contingency spell can be placed 
on the spellcaster at any one time; if a sec- 
ond is cast, the first one (if still active) is 
cancelled. The conditions needed to bring 
the spell into effect must be clear, although 
they can be rather general. For example, a 
contingency spell cast with an airy water 
spell might prescribe that any time the wiz- 
ard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in 
water or similar liquid, the airy water spell 
will instantly come into effect. Or a contin- 
gency could bring a feather fall spell into ef- 
fect any time the wizard falls more than two 
feet. In all cases, the contingency immedi- 
ately brings into effect the second spell, the 
latter being “cast” instantaneously when the 
prescribed circumstances occur, Note 


that if complicated or convoluted condi- 
tions are prescribed, the whole spell com- 
plex (the contingency spell and the compan- 
ion magic) may fail when called upon. 

The material components of this spell are 
(in addition to those of the companion spell) 
100 gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash 
of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell- 
using creature. In addition, the spell re- 
quires a statuette of the wizard carved from 
elephant ivory (which is not destroyed, 
though it is subject to wear and tear), which 
must be carried on the person of the spell- 
caster for the contingency spell to perform 
its function when called upon. 


Control Weather (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 4d6 hours 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 4d4 square miles 
Saving Throw: None 


The control weather spell enables a wiz- 
ard to change the weather in the local area. 
The spell affects the weather for 4d6 hours 
in an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires 
one turn to cast the spell, and an additional 
1d4 turns for the weather conditions to oc- 
cur. The current weather conditions are de- 
cided by the DM, depending on the climate 
and season. Weather conditions have three 
components: precipitation, temperature, 
and wind. The spell can change these condi- 
tions according to the following chart. 

The upper-cased headings represent the 
existing weather conditions. The small 
headings beneath each large heading are the 
new conditions to which the caster can 
change the existing conditions. Further- 
more, the caster can control the direction of 
the wind. For example, a day that is clear 
and warm with moderate wind can be con- 
trolled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Con- 
tradictions are not possible—fog and strong 
wind, for example. Multiple control weath-

Wizard Spells (6th Level) 


er spells can be used only in succession. 

The material components for this spell are 
burning incense and bits of earth and wood 
mixed in water. Obviously, this spell func- 
tions only in areas where there are appropri- 
ate climatic conditions. 


Death Fog (Alteration, Evocation) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Two 10-foot cubes/level 
Saving Throw: None 


The casting of a death fog spell creates an 
area of solid fog that has the additional 
property of being highly acidic. The vapors 
are deadly to living things, so that vegeta- 
tion exposed to them will die—grass and 
similar small plants in two rounds, bushes 
and shrubs in four, small trees in eight, and 
large trees in 16 rounds. Animal life not 
immune to acid suffers damage according to 
the length of time it is exposed to the vapors 
of a death fog, as follows: 


1st round: 1 point 

2nd round: 2 points 

3rd round: 4 points 

4th and each succeeding round: 8 points 


The death fog otherwise resembles the 
2nd-level fog cloud: rolling, billowing 
vapors that can be moved only by a very 
strong wind. Any creature attempting to 
move through the death fog progresses at a 
rate of but one foot per unit of normal 
movement rate per round. A gust of wind 
spell cannot affect it. A fireball, flame 
strike, or a wall of fire can burn it away ina 
single round. 

The material components are a pinch of 
dried and powdered peas, powdered animal 
hoof, and strong acid of any sort (including 
highly distilled vinegar or acid crystals), 
which must be obtained from an alchemist. 


Death Spell (Necromancy) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Instantaneous 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: One 30-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When a death spell is cast, it snuffs out the 
life forces of creatures in the area of effect 
instantly and irrevocably. Such creatures 
cannot be raised or resurrected, but an indi- 
vidual slain in this manner might be brought 
back via a wish. The number of creatures 
that can be slain is a function of their Hit 
Dice. 


Maximum # of 
Creatures’ Hit Dice Creatures Affected 
Under 2 4d20 
2to4 2d20 
4+1to6+t+3 2d4 
6+4to8+3 1d4 


If creatures of differing Hit Dice are 
attacked with a death spell, roll the dice 
(4d20) to determine how many creatures of 
under 2 Hit Dice are affected. If the number 
rolled is greater than the actual number of 
sub-2 Hit Dice creatures, apply the remain- 
der of the roll to the higher Hit Dice crea- 
tures by consulting the following table. 


Conversion 

Creature’s Hit Dice Factor (CF) 
Under 2 1 
2to4 2 
4+1to6+3 10 
6+4to8+3 20 


In other words, from the 4d20 roll sub- 
tract the number of creatures of less than 2 
Hit Dice (these creatures die). If there are 
any remaining points from the 4d20 roll, 
subtract 2 for each creature of 2 to 4 Hit 
Dice (these creatures also die). If this still 
doesn’t use up all the 4d20 roll, subtract 10 
for each creature of 4+1 to 6+3 Hit Dice, 
and so on. Stop when all the creatures are 
dead, all the 4d20 roll is used up, or the 
remainder is less than 1/2 of the CF of any 
remaining creatures. (If the remainder is 1/2 
or more of the CF of a creature, that crea- 
ture dies.) 

Example: A mixed group of 20 goblins, 
eight gnolls, and four ogres, led by a hill 
giant, are caught in the area of a death spell. 
The 4d20 roll gives a total of 53 points; 20 of 
this eliminates the goblins (20 X 1 CF), 16 
kills the gnolls (8 * 2 CF), and the remain- 
ing 17 kills two ogres (10 points to kill one 
ogre, and the remaining 7 points are enough 
to kill one more ogre). The other two ogres 
and the hill giant are unharmed. 

A death spell does not affect lycan- 
thropes, undead creatures, or creatures 
from planes other than the Prime Material. 

The material component of this spell is a 
crushed black pearl with a minimum value 
of 1,000 gp. 


Demi-Shadow Magic 
(Iusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: Special 


This spell is similar to the 5th-level 
shadow magic spell, but this spell enables 
the casting of partially real 4th- and Sth 


175 


level evocations (cone of cold, wall of fire, 
wall of ice, cloudkill, etc.). If recognized as 
demi-shadow magic (if a saving throw vs. 
spell is successful), damaging spells inflict 
only 40% of normal damage, with a mini- 
mum of 2 points per die of damage. A demi- 
magic cloudkill slays creatures with fewer 
than 2 Hit Dice and inflicts 1d2 points of 
damage per round. 


Disintegrate (Alteration) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell causes matter to vanish. It 
affects even matter (or energy) of a magical 
nature, such as Bigby’s forceful hand, but 
not a globe of invulnerability or an anti- 
magic shell. Disintegration is instantane- 
ous, and its effects are permanent. Any 
single creature can be affected, even 
undead. Nonliving matter, up toa 10’ X 10’ 
X 10‘ cube, can be obliterated by the spell. 
The spell creates a thin, green ray that 
causes physical material touched to glow 
and vanish, leaving traces of fine dust. 
Creatures that successfully save vs. spell 
have avoided the ray (material items have 
resisted the magic) and are not affected. 
Only the first creature or object struck can 
be affected. 

The material components are a lodestone 
and a pinch of dust. 


Enchant an Item 
(Enchantment, Invocation) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: 1 item 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This is a spell that must be used by a wiz- 
ard planning to create a magical item. The 
enchant an item spell prepares the object to 
accept the magic. The item must meet the 
following tests: 1) it must be in sound and 
undamaged condition; 2) the item must be 
the finest possible, considering its nature, 
i.e., crafted of the highest quality material 
and with the finest workmanship; 3) its cost 
or value must reflect the second test, and in 
most cases the item must have a raw- 
materials cost in excess of 100 gp. With 
respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to 
apply this test to items such as ropes, leather 
goods, cloth, and pottery not normally 
embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or 
engraved. If such work or materials can be 
added to an item without weakening or 
harming its normal functions, however, 


Wizard Spells (Gth Level) 


these are required for the item to be 
enchanted. 

The wizard must have access to a work- 
shop or laboratory, properly equipped and 
from which contaminating magic can be 
screened. Any magical item not related to 
the fabrication process (such as most pro- 
tective devices) and within 30 feet of the 
materials is a source of contaminating magic 
and will spoil the process. 

The item to be prepared must be touched 
by the spell caster. This touching must be 
constant and continual during the casting 
time, which is a base 16 hours plus an addi- 
tional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never 
work more than eight hours per day, and 
haste or any other spells will not alter the 
time required in any way, this effectively 
means that casting time for this spell is two 
days + 1d8 days). All work must be unin- 
terrupted, and during rest periods the item 
being enchanted must never be more than 
one foot distant from the spellcaster, for if it 
is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be 
begun again. (Note that during rest periods 
absolutely no other form of magic can be 
performed, and the wizard must remain qui- 
et and in isolation or the enchantment is 
ruined.) 

At the end of the spell, the caster will 
know that the item is ready for the final test. 
He will then pronounce the final magical 
syllable, and if the item makes a saving 
throw (which is exactly the same as that of 
the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. 
The spellcaster’s saving throw bonuses also 
apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on 
the 1d20 roll always results in failure, 
regardless of modifications. Once the spell 
is finished, the wizard can begin to place the 
desired spell upon the item. The spell he 
plans to place must be cast within 24 hours 
or the preparatory spell fades, and the item 
must be enchanted again. 

Each spell subsequently cast upon an 
object bearing an enchant an item spell 
requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the mag- 
ic being cast. Again, during casting the item 
must be touched by the wizard, and during 
the rest periods it must always be within one 
foot of his person. This procedure holds 
true for any additional spells placed upon 
the item, and each successive spell must be 
begun within 24 hours of the last, even if the 
prior spell failed. 

No magic placed on an item is permanent 
unless a permanency spell is used as a finish- 
ing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of 
draining 1 point of Constitution from the 
wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is 
possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant 
an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if 
successive castings actually work, for each 
must make the same sort of saving throw as 
the item itself made. Naturally, items that 
are charged—rods, staves, wands, javelins 
of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.—can never 


be made permanent. Magical devices can- 
not be used to enchant an item or cast magic 
upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can 
be used for this purpose. 

The materials needed for this spell vary 
according to both the nature of the item 
being enchanted and the magic to be cast 
upon it. For example, a cloak of displace- 
ment might require the hides of one or more 
displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay 
dragons could require the blood and some 
other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will 
be effective against, and a ring of shooting 
stars might require pieces of meteorites and 
the horn of a ki-rin. These specifics, as well 
as other information pertaining to this spell, 
are decided by your Dungeon Master and 
must be discovered or researched in play. 


Ensnarement (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


Casting this spell attempts a dangerous 
act: to lure a powerful creature from 
another plane to a specially prepared trap, 
where it will be held until it agrees to per- 
form one service in return for freedom from 
the ensnarement spell. The type of creature 
to be ensnared must be known and stated, 
and if it has a specific, proper, or given 
name, this must be used in casting the 
ensnarement spell. The spell causes an 
awareness of a gate-like opening on the 
plane of the creature to be ensnared. A spe- 
cial saving throw is then made to determine 
if the creature detects the nature of the pla- 
nar opening as a trap or believes it to be a 
gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to 
or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. 
The score is modified by the difference 
between the creature's Intelligence and that 
of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher 
score, the difference is subtracted from its 
dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a high- 
er score, the difference is added to the dice 
roll. 

If the saving throw succeeds, the creature 
ignores the spell-created opening, and the 
spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the crea- 
ture steps into the opening and is ensnared. 

When so trapped, the other-planar crea- 
ture can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, 
unless the caster has created a warding cir- 
cle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn 
by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). 
Even with such protection, the entrapped 
creature may break free and wreak its 
vengeance upon the spellcaster. 

A hand-drawn circle has a base failure 
chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved 
has a base of 10% (and that is for the first 


176 


time it is used, to determine whether or not 
the job was done properly). The base 
chance is modified by the difference 
between the wizard’s combined Intelligence 
and experience level and the Intelligence and 
the experience level or Hit Dice of the crea- 
ture ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher 
total, that difference in percentage points is 
subtracted from the chance for the creature 
to break free. If the creature has a higher 
total, that difference is added to its chance 
to break free. 

The chance can be further reduced by 
careful preparation of the circle. If the hand- 
made circle is drawn over a longer period of 
time, using specially prepared pigments 
(1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the 
chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for 
every turn spent in preparation. This can 
bring the base chance to 0%. 

Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can 
be brought to a 0% chance of the creature 
breaking free by inlaying with various 
metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require 
a minimum of one full month of time and 
add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost 
of having the circle inlaid or carved into 
stone. Any break in the circle spoils the effi- 
cacy of the spell and enables the creature to 
break free automatically. Even a straw 
dropped across the line of a magic circle 
destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature 
within cannot so much as place a straw 
upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for 
the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents 
it. 

Once safely ensnared, the creature can be 
kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. 
(Remember the danger of something break- 
ing the ward!) The creature cannot leave the 
circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers 
penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer 
bribes, use promises, or make threats in 
order to exact one service from the <aptive 
creature. 

The DM will then assign a value to what 
the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, 
rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most 
persuasive). This rating is then subtracted 
from the Intelligence score of the creature. If 
the creature rolls a successful Intelligence 
check against its adjusted Intelligence, it 
refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can 
be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours 
later, when the creature's Intelligence has 
dropped by 1 point due to confinement. 
This can be repeated until the creature 
promises to serve, until it breaks free, or 
until the caster decides to get rid of it by 
means of some riddance spell. Impossible 
demands or unreasonable commands are 
never agreed to. 

Once the single service is completed, the 
creature need only so inform the spellcaster 
to be instantly sent from whence it came. 
The creature might later seek revenge. 


Wizard Spells (6th Level) 


Extension Ill (Alteration) 


Range: 0 
Components: V 
Duration; Special 

ing Time: 6 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell is the same as the 4th-level 
extension I spell, except that it will extend 
1st- through 3rd-level spells to double dura- 
tion and will extend the duration of 4th- or 
5Sth-level spells by 50%. 


Eyebite (Enchantment/Charm, 
Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 20 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 round/3 levels 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 


An eyebite spell enables the caster to 
merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak 
a single word to cause an effect. This gaze 
attack is in addition to any other attacks 
allowed the wizard, The wizard selects one 
of four possible gaze attacks at the time the 
spell is cast, and this attack cannot be 
changed. For example, a 12th-level caster 
who chose fear would have four opportuni- 
ties to make gaze attacks causing fear, one 
for each round of the spell’s duration. Any 
gaze attack is negated by a successful saving 
throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. 
The four effects of the spell are as follows: 

Charm: The wizard can charm a single 
person or monster by gaze and by uttering a 
single word. The effect is to make the 
charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile 
to the caster, even to the point of personal 
danger. It is otherwise the same as a charm 
monster spell, All creatures other than 
humans, demihumans, and humanoids save 
with +2 bonuses. 

Fear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze 
and by speaking a single word. The subject 
flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds, After 
this, the creature refuses to face the caster 
and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if 
subsequently confronted by the caster (50% 
chance of either), The latter effect lasts one 
turn per caster level. This attack can be 
negated by spells that counter fear. 

Sicken: This power enables the caster to 
merely gaze, speak a word, and cause sud- 
den pain and fever to sweep over the sub- 
ject’s body. Creatures with ability scores 
function at half effectiveness, others inflict 
only one-half damage with physical attacks. 
Movement is at one-half normal rate. The 
subject remains stricken for one turn per 
level of the caster, after which all abilities 
return at the rate of one point per turn of 


complete rest or one point per hour of mod- 
erate activity. The effects cannot be negated 
by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove 
curse or successful dispel magic spell is 
effective. Creatures other than humans, 
demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 
bonuses versus this attack. 

Sleep: The wizard can cause any individ- 
ual to fall into a comatose slumber by means 
of a gaze and a single word, unless the sub- 
ject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. 
spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st- 
level sleep spell save with —2 penalties. An 
affected creature must be shaken or other- 
wise shocked back to consciousness. 

In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed 
factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead 
of any type, or extend beyond the plane 
occupied by the caster. Note that the caster 
is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze, 
and is allowed any applicable saving throw. 
In the case of a reflected charm gaze, the 
caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is 
countered. 


Geas (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


A geas spell places a magical command 
upon a creature (usually human or human- 
oid) to carry out some service, or to refrain 
from some action or course of activity, as 
desired by the spellcaster. The creature must 
be intelligent, conscious, under its own voli- 
tion, and able to understand the caster. 
While a geas cannot compel a creature to 
kill itself or to perform acts that are likely to 
result in certain death, it can cause almost 
any other course of action. The geased crea- 
ture must follow the given instructions until 
the geas is completed. Failure to do so will 
cause the creature to grow sick and die with- 
in 1d4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of 
the instructions causes corresponding loss 
of Strength points until the deviation ceases. 
A geas can be done away with by a wish 
spell, but a dispel magic or remove curse 
spell will not negate it. Your DM will decide 
any additional details of a geas, for its cast- 
ing and fulfillment are tricky, and an 
improperly cast geas is ignored. 


Glassee (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard is able 
to make a section of metal, stone, or wood 
as transparent as glass to his gaze, or even 
make it into transparent material as 
explained hereafter. Normally, up to four 
inches of metal can be seen through, stone 
up to six inches thick can be made transpar- 
ent, and 20 inches of wood can be affected 
by the glassee spell. The spell will not work 
on lead, gold, or platinum. The wizard can 
opt to make the glassee work only for him- 
self for the duration of the spell, or he can 
actually make a transparent area, a one- 
way window, in the material affected. 
Either case gives a viewing area 3’ wide by 2' 
high. If a window is created, it has the 
strength of the original material. 

The material component of the spell is a 
small piece of crystal or glass. 


Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell creates an immobile, faintly 
shimmering, magical sphere around the 
caster that prevents any Ist-, 2nd-, 3rd-, or 
4th-level spell effects from penetrating. 
Thus the area of effect of any such spell does 
not include the area of the globe of invulner- 
ability. This includes innate spell-like abili- 
ties and effects from devices. However, any 
type of spell can be cast out of the magical 
sphere, and these pass from the caster of the 
globe to the subject without effect upon the 
globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not 
affected by the globe. The globe can be 
brought down by a successful dispel magic 


spell. 

The material component of the spell is a 
glass or crystal bead that shatters at the 
expiration of the spell. 


Wizard Spells (6th Level) 


Guards and Wards (Evocation, 
Alteration, Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 0 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 3 turns 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This special and powerful spell is primari- 
ly used to defend the wizard’s stronghold. 
The ward protects a one-storey stronghold, 
with a base dimension of 400’ x 400’. The 
wizard can ward a multi-storey area by 
reducing the base area proportionately. The 
following take place in the warded area 
upon casing of the spell: 


1. All corridors become misty, and visibil- 
ity is reduced to 10 feet. 

2. All doors are wizard locked. 

3. Stairs are filled with webs from top to 
bottom. These act as the 2nd-level web 
spell, except that they regrow within one 
turn if destroyed. 

4. Where there are choices in direction— 
such as a cross or side passage—a minor 
confusion-type spell functions so as to 
make it 50% probable that intruders 
believe they are going in the exact oppo- 
site direction. 

5. The whole area radiates magic. The nor- 
mal use of the detect magic spell becomes 
impossible for those of less than the cast- 
er’s level and difficult for others. 

6. One door per level of experience of the 
wizard is covered by an illusion to 
appear as if it were a plain wall. 

7. The wizard can place one of the follow- 
ing additional magical effects: 

A. Dancing lights in four corridors 

B. Magic mouth in two places 

C. Stinking cloud in two places 

D. Gust of wind in one corridor or room 
E. Suggestion in one place. 


Note that items 6 and 7 function only 
when the wizard is totally familiar with the 
area of the spell’s effect. Dispel magic can 
remove one effect, at random, per casting. 
A remove curse spell will not work. 

The material components of the spell are 
burning incense, a small measure of sulphur 
and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of 
umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod. 


Invisible Stalker 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell summons an invisible stalker 
from the elemental plane of Air. This 8 Hit 
Dice monster obeys and serves the spellcast- 
er in performing whatever tasks are set 
before it. It is a faultless tracker within one 
day of the quarry’s passing. The invisible 
stalker follows instructions even if they send 
him hundreds or thousands of miles away 
and, once given an order, follows through 
unceasingly until the task is accomplished. 
However, the creature is bound to serve; it 
does not do so from loyalty or desire. 
Therefore, it resents prolonged missions or 
complex tasks, and it attempts to pervert 
instructions accordingly. Invisible stalkers 
understand common speech but speak no 
language save their own. 

The material components of this spell are 
burning incense and a piece of horn carved 
into a crescent shape. 


Legend Lore (Divination) 


Range: 0 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The legend lore spell is used to determine 
legendary information regarding a known 
person, place, or thing. If the person or 
thing is at hand, or if the wizard is in the 
place in question, the likelihood of the spell 
producing results is far greater and the cast- 
ing time is only 1d4 turns. If only detailed 
information on the person, place, or thing is 
known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only 
rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 
weeks, 

During the casting, the wizard cannot 
engage in activities other than the routine: 
eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the 
divination reveals if legendary material is 
available. It often reveals where this materi- 
al is—by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It 
sometimes gives certain information regard- 
ing the person, place, or thing (when the 
object of the legend lore is at hand), but this 
data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, 
riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). 

The spell is cast with incense and strips of 
ivory formed into a rectangle, but some 
item of value to the caster must be sacrificed 
in addition—a potion, magical scroll, magi- 
cal item, etc. 

Naturally, legend lore reveals informa- 


178 


tion only if the person, place, or thing is 
noteworthy or legendary. 

Suppose Delsenora came across an 
extremely well-made sword. It radiates 
magic, but when she used an identify spell, 
she could not learn any information. Even 
giving it to a trusted fighter didn’t work as 
the sword did not reveal any special 
powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, 
hoping to gain more information. Since the 
sword is at hand, she completes the spell in 
three turns. In her mind comes the message, 
“Once this was the sword of he who waits 
till Albion’s time of greatest peril, when 
unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the 
hand that gave me and fair was the hand 
that reclaimed me.” Clearly, Delsenora real- 
izes, this must be a very powerful item, 
since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. 
But who is he who waits? And where is 
Albion? For more information, Delsenora is 
going to have to cast more spells. But now 
the process will take much longer, since she 
has only the vaguest of clues to follow. 


Lower Water (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 80 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 5 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 10-foot square area/level. 
Saving Throw: None 


The wizard casting a lower water spell 
causes water or similar fluid in the area of 
effect to sink away. The water can be lowered 
up to two feet for every experience level of 
the wizard, to a minimum depth of one inch. 
The water is lowered within a square area 
whose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. 
Thus, a 12th-level wizard affects a volume 
24' X 120' X 120’, a 13th-level caster a vol- 
ume of 26’ X 130’ X 130’, and so on. In 
extremely large and deep bodies of water, 
such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirl- 
pool that sweeps ships and similar craft 
downward, putting them at risk and render- 
ing them unable to leave by normal move- 
ment for the duration of the spell. When cast 
on water elementals and other water-based 
creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell: the 
creature moves at half speed and makes half 
the number of attacks each round. It has no 
effect on other creatures. 

The material component of this spell is a 
small vial of dust. 

Its reverse, raise water, causes water or 
similar fluids to return to their highest natu- 
ral level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This 
can make fords impassable, float grounded 
ships, and may even sweep away bridges at 
the referee's option. It negates lower water 
and vice versa. 

The material component of the raise 
water spell is a small vial of water. 


Wizard Spells (Gth Level) 


Mass Suggestion 
(Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, M 

Duration: 4 turns + 4 turns/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 1 creature/level 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The mass suggestion spell enables the wiz- 
ard to influence the actions of one or more 
chosen creatures in the same way as the sug- 
gestion spell. Up to one creature per experi- 
ence level of the caster can be influenced, 
provided that all subject creatures are with- 
in the 30-yard range. Undead are not subject 
to this spell. The suggestion must be reason- 
ably worded and understood by the crea- 
tures, and must be the same for all hearing 
it. Creatures successfully saving vs. spell are 
unaffected. Saving throws against the spell 
suffer a penalty of —1, and if a single crea- 
ture is to be affected, its saving throw suf- 
fers a —4 penalty. Note that a very 
reasonable mass suggestion can cause the 
saving throw to be made with an additional 
penalty (such as —1, —2, etc.) at the discre- 
tion of your DM. A mass suggestion can 
continue in effect for a considerable dura- 
tion, at the DM's discretion. Conditions that 
will trigger a special action can also be speci- 
fied; if the condition is not met before the 
spell expires, then the action will not be per- 
formed. 

The material components of this spell are 
a snake's tongue and either a bit of honey- 
comb or a drop of sweet oil. 


Mirage Arcana 
(Ilusion/Phantasm, Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S,(M optional) 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: Special 

Area of Effect: 10 feet/level radius 
Saving Throw: None 


The magic of this spell is similar to that of 
the vacancy spell, only this is more power- 
ful and elaborate. The spell enables the cast- 
er to make an area appear to be something 
other than it is, a setting he has personally 
seen. The spell remains as long as the caster 
maintains a minimal concentration upon it. 
Even after this, the spell persists for a total 
of one hour plus one additional turn for 
each experience level of the caster. (Note: 
Minimal concentration can be maintained 
during normal conversation but not while 
spellcasting, in melee, or if harmed by an 
attack.) If the caster actually uses a small bit 
of anything connected with the place to cre- 
ate this spell, then it takes on a quasi-reality. 

In its basic form, forceful contact is neces- 
sary to have any hope of discovering the 


magic, short of a detection device or spell. 
In its more complex form, where a material 
component is used, detection is possible 
only by some magical means, whether 
device, item, or spell. Either form of mirage 
arcana is subject to the dispel magic spell. 
As with all powerful illusions, the mind 
of the believer urges appropriate effects 
upon the viewer's body. Under the influence 
of the spell, the viewer could possibly walk 
across a bed of hot coals thinking it was a 
shallow stream of water that was cooling his 
feet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon 
imaginary food and actually be satisfied, or 
rest comfortably upon a bed of sharp 
stones, thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is 
not affected by the spell, however, so that 
an envisioned bridge spanning a deep chasm 
does not support the believer. Those who 
witness the event see it as a sudden disap- 
pearance of the individual. They do not 
connect it with an illusion unless they are 
otherwise aware of some magic at work. 


Mislead ([llusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards 
Component: S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When a mislead spell is cast by the wiz- 
ard, he actually creates an illusory double at 
the same time that he is cloaked by 
improved invisibility magic (see the 4th- 
level spell). The wizard is then free to go 
elsewhere while his double seemingly moves 
away. The spell enables the illusion of the 
wizard to speak and gesture as if it were 
real, and there are full olfactory and touch 
components as well. A true seeing spell or a 
gem of seeing will reveal the illusion for 
what it is. A detect invisibility or true seeing 
spell, or items such as a gem of seeing or 
robe of eyes can detect the invisible wizard 
(see the Sth-level wizard spell, shadow 
door). 


Monster Summoning IV 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- 
ster summoning I spell, except that this spell 
summons 1d3 4th-level monsters. These 
appear within spell range and attack the 
casters opponents, until he commands them 
to cease, the spell duration expires, or the 
monsters are slain. These creatures do not 


179 


check morale; they vanish when slain. If no 
opponent exists to fight, summoned mon- 
sters can, if the wizard can communicate 
with them, and if they are physically capa- 
ble, perform other services for the summon- 
ing wizard. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) 
candle. 


Mordenkainen’s Lucubration 
(Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


By use of this spell, the wizard is able to 
instantly recall any 1st- through 5th-level 
spell he has used during the past 24 hours. 
The spell must have been memorized and 
actually used during that time period. Mor- 
denkainen's lucubration allows the recovery 
of only one spell. If the recalled spell 
requires material components, these must 
be provided by the caster; the recovered 
spell is not usable until the material compo- 
nents are available. 


Move Earth (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When cast, the move earth spell moves 
dirt (clay, loam, sand) and its other compo- 
nents. Thus embankments can be collapsed, 
hillocks moved, dunes shifted, etc. How- 
ever, in no event can rock prominences be 
collapsed or moved. The area to be affected 
dictates the casting time; for every 40 yd. x 
40 yd. surface area and 10 feet of depth, one 
turn of casting time is required. The maxi- 
mum area that can be affected is 240 yd. x 
240 yd., which takes four hours. If terrain 
features are to be moved—as compared to 
simply caving in banks or walls of earth—it 
is necessary that an earth elemental be sub- 
sequently summoned to assist. All spell 
casting or summoning must be completed 
before any effects occur. As any summoned 
earth elemental will perform most of its 
work underground, it is unlikely that it will 
be intercepted or interrupted. Should this 
occur, however, the movement of the earth 
requiring its services must be stopped until 
the elemental is once again available. 
Should the elemental be slain or dismissed, 
the move earth spell is limited to collapsing 
banks or walls of earth. 


Wizard Spells (6th Level) 


The spell cannot be used for tunneling, 
and is generally too slow to trap or bury 
creatures; its primary use is for digging or 
filling moats or for adjusting terrain con- 
tours before a battle. 

The material components for this spell are 
a mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a 
small bag and an iron blade. 

Note: This spell does not violently break 
the surface of the ground. Instead it creates 
wave-like crests and troughs, with the earth 
reacting with glacier-like fluidity until the 
desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, 
rock formations, and so on, are relatively 
unaffected, save for changes in elevation 
and relative topography. 


Otiluke’s Freezing Sphere 
(Alteration, Evocation) 


Range: Special 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


Otiluke'’s Freezing Sphere is a multi- 

purpose spell of considerable power. If the 
caster opts, he may create any of the follow- 
ing: 
A) Frigid globe. A small globe of matter at 
absolute zero temperature that spreads 
upon contact with water, or a liquid that is 
principally water, freezing it to a depth of 
six inches over an area equal to 100 square 
feet per level of the mage casting the spell. 
This ice lasts for one round per level of the 
caster. 

The material component is a thin sheet of 
crystal about an inch square. 


B) Cold ray. The spell can also be used as a 
thin ray of cold that springs from the caster’s 
hand to a distance of 10 yards per level of 
the wizard; this ray inflicts 1d4 +2 points of 
damage per level of the caster upon the first 
creature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is 
applicable; all damage is negated if it is suc- 
cessful (as the ray is so narrow a save indi- 
cates it missed). If the first creature is 
missed, the path of the ray is plotted to its 
full distance, and anything else in its path 
must save (if applicable) or suffer appropri- 
ate damage. 

The material component is a white sap- 
phire of not less than 1,000 gp value. 


C) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe 
about the size of a sling stone, cool to the 
touch, but not harmful. This globe can be 
hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 
yards (considered short range), or as a sling 
bullet. The globe shatters upon impact, 
inflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon 
all creatures within a 10-foot radius (one- 
half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is 


successful). Use the Dungeon Master's 
Guide Grenade-Like Missile Table to find 
where misses strike. Note that if the globe is 
not thrown or slung within one round per 
level of the spell-caster, it shatters and 
causes cold damage as stated above. This 
timed effect can be employed against pursu- 
ers, although it can prove hazardous to the 
spellcaster and his associates as well. 

The material component is a 1,000-gp 
diamond. 


Part Water (Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By employing a part water spell, the wiz- 
ard is able to cause water or similar liquid to 
move apart, thus forming a 20-foot-wide 
trough. The depth and length of the trough 
are dependent upon the level of the wizard, 
and a trough three feet deep by 10 yards 
long is created per level. For example, at 
12th level the wizard would part water 36 
feet deep by 20 feet wide by 120 yards long. 
The trough remains as long as the spell lasts 
or until the wizard who cast it opts to end its 
effects. If cast underwater, this spell creates 
an air cylinder of appropriate length and 
diameter, If cast directly on a water elemen- 
tal or other water-based creature, the crea- 
ture receives 4d8 damage and must roll a 
successful saving throw vs. spell or flee in 
panic for 3d4 rounds. 

The material components for the spell are 
two small sheets of crystal or glass. 


Permanent Illusion (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ cube/level 
Saving Throw: Special 


When this spell is cast, the wizard creates 
an illusion with visual, auditory, olfactory, 
and thermal elements. The spell can create 
the illusion of any object, creature, or force, 
as long as it is within the boundaries of the 
spell’s area of effect. It affects all creatures 
that view the illusion, even to the extent of 
them suffering damage from falling into an 
illusory pit full of sharp spikes. 

Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the 
illusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if 
successful, they see it for what it is and add 
+4 bonuses to associates’ saving throws, if 
this knowledge can be communicated effec- 
tively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect 
are immune until they become aware of it. 
The permanent illusion is subject to a dispel 


magic spell, of course. 
The material component of the spell is a 
bit of fleece. 


Programmed Illusion 
(Iusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ cube/level 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell creates a spectral force spell 
that activates upon command or when a 
specific condition occurs. The illusion has 
visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal ele- 
ments. It can be of any object, creature, or 
force, as long as it remains within the 
boundaries of the spell’s area of effect. 

The occurrence that begins the illusion 
can be as general or as specific and detailed 
as desired, such as the following: “Begin 
only when a venerable female human carry- 
ing a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged 
within one foot of this spot.” Such visual 
triggers can react to a character using the 
disguise ability. Command range is five 
yards per level of the wizard, so a 12th-level 
mage can command the programmed illu- 
sion to occur at a maximum encounter 
range of 60 yards. A programmed illusion 
cannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor 
alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except 
by external garb. If desired, the effect can be 
keyed to a specific noise or spoken word. 
The spell lasts until the illusion occurs, thus 
the spell duration is variable. The illusion 
will last for a maximum of one round per 
level of the spellcaster. 

Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the 
illusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if 
successful, they see it for what it is and add 
+4 bonuses to associates’ saving throws, if 
this knowledge can be communicated effec- 
tively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect 
are immune until they become aware of it. 
The illusion is subject to a dispel magic 
spell. 

The material component of the spell is a 
bit of fleece. 


Project Image 
(Alteration, Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard creates 
a nonmaterial duplicate of himself, project- 
ing it to any spot within spell range. This 
image performs actions decided by the 


Wizard Spells (6th Level) 


wizard—walking, speaking, spellcasting— 
conforming to the actual actions of the wiz- 
ard unless he concentrates on making it act 
differently (in which case the wizard is lim- 
ited to half movement and no attacks). 

The image can be dispelled only by means 
of a successful dispel magic spell (or upon 
command from the spellcaster); attacks pass 
harmlessly through it. The image must be 
within view of the wizard projecting it at all 
times, and if his sight is obstructed, the spell 
is broken. Note that if the wizard is invisible 
at the time the spell is cast, the image is also 
invisible until the caster’s invisibility ends, 
though the wizard must still be able to see 
the image (by means of a detect invisibility 
spell or other method) to maintain the spell. 
If the wizard uses dimension door, teleport, 
plane shift, or similar spell that breaks his 
line of vision, the project image spell ends. 

The material component of this spell is a 
siall replica (doll) of the wizard. 


Reincarnation (Necromancy) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Person touched 
Saving Throw: None 


With this spell, the wizard can bring back 
to life a person who died no more than one 
day per level of experience of the wizard 
before the casting of the spell. The essence 
of the dead person is transferred to another 
body, possibly one very different from his 
former body. Reincarnation does not 
require any saving throw, system shock, or 
resurrection survival roll. The corpse is 
touched, and a new incarnation of the per- 
son will appear in the area in 1d6 turns. The 
person reincarnated recalls the majority of 
his former life and form, but the character 
class, if any, of the new incarnation might 
be different indeed. The new incarnation is 
determined on the following table. If a play- 
er character race is indicated, the character 
must be created. 


tase Roll Incarnation 
12-18 Elf 
19-23 Gnoll 
24-28 Gnome 
29-33 _ Goblin 
55-59 Hobgoblin 
60-73 Human 
74-79 Kobold 
80-85 , 3 ch » / 


Troll 


Note: Very good or very evil persons will 
not be reincarnated as creatures whose gen- 
eral alignment is the opposite. 

The material components of the spell are 
a small drum and a drop of blood. 


Repulsion (Abjuration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/2 levels 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect; Creatures in a 
10-foot-wide path 

Saving Throw: None 


Wher this spell is cast, the wizard is able 
to cause all creatures in the path of the area 
of effect to move directly away from his per- 
son. Repulsion occurs at the speed of the 
creature attempting to move toward the 
spellcaster. The repelled creature continues 
to move away for a complete round even if 
this takes it beyond spell range. The caster 
can designate a new direction each round, 
but use of this power counts as the caster’s 
principal action in the round. The caster 
can, of course, choose to do something else 
instead of using the repulsion attack. 

The material component for this spell is a 
pair of small magnetized iron bars attached 
to two small canine statuettes, one ivory 
and one ebony. 


Shades (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell is related to the shadow mon- 
sters and demi-shadow monsters spells. The 
shades spell uses material from the plane of 
Shadow to form semi-real illusions of one or 
more monsters, up to 1 Hit Die per caster 
level. All shades created by one spell must 
be of the same sort, and they have 60% of 
the hit point total the real creatures would 
have. Those viewing the shades and failing 
their saving throws vs. spell believe the illu- 
sion. 

The shades perform as the real monsters 
with respect to Armor Class and attack 
forms. Special attack forms such as petrifi- 
cation or level drain do not actually occur, 
but a subject who believes the shades are 
real will react appropriately, until the illu- 
sion is countered by a dispel magic spell or 
the condition is countered by a heal spell. 
Those who roll successful saving throws see 
the shades as transparent images superim- 
posed on vague shadowy forms. These are 
Armor Class 6 and cause only 60% of the 
true monsters’ normal melee damage. 


Stone to Flesh (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 


The stone to flesh spell turns any sort of 
stone into flesh. If the recipient stone object 
was formerly living, this spell restores life 
(and goods), although the survival of the 
creature is subject to the usual system shock 
survival roll. Any formerly living creature, 
regardless of size, can be thus returned to 
flesh. Ordinary stone can be turned to flesh 
in a volume of nine cubic feet per level of 
experience of the spellcaster. Such flesh is 
inert, lacking a vital life force, unless a life 
force or magical energy is available (for 
example, this spell would turn a stone golem 
into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue 
would become a body). If cast upon stone, 
the wizard can create a cylinder of fleshy 
material from one to three feet in diameter 
and up to 10 feet long, allowing a passage to 
be made. 

The material components are a pinch of 
earth and a drop of blood. 

The reverse, flesh to stone, turns flesh of 
any sort to stone. All possessions on the per- 
son of the creature likewise turn to stone. 
The intended subject of the spell receives a 
saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If 
a statue created by this spell is subjected to 
breakage or weathering, the being (if ever 
returned to his original, fleshy state) will 
have similar damage, deformities, etc. The 
DM may allow such damage to be repaired 
by various high-level clerical spells, such as 
regenerate. 

The material components of the spell are 
lime, water, and earth. 


Tenser’s Transformation 
(Alteration, Evocation) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


Tenser's transformation is a sight guaran- 
teed to astound any creature not aware of its 
power, for when the wizard casts the spell, 
he undergoes a startling transformation. 
The size and strength of the wizard increase 
to heroic proportions, so he becomes a for- 
midable fighting machine; the spell causes- 
the caster to become a berserk fighter! The 
wizard’s hit points double, and all damage 
he sustains comes first from the magical 
points gained; once these points are elimi- 


Wizard Spells (7th Level) 


nated, all subsequent damage (to his true hit 
points) is doubled. The Armor Class of the 
wizard is 4 better than that he possessed pri- 
or to casing the spell (AC 10 goes to 6, AC9 
to 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), toa maximum Armor 
Class of —10. 

All attacks are as a fighter of the same 
level as the wizard (i.e., the wizard uses the 
combat values normally reserved for fight- 
ers). The wizard can use either a dagger or a 
staff when attacking. A dagger can be used 
twice per round, and each successful attack 
inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. A 
staff can be used only once per round, but 
with a +2 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls, The wizard fights in melee in prefer- 
ence to all other forms of attack, and con- 
tinues attacking until all opponents are 
slain, he is killed, the magic is dispelled, or 
the spell duration expires. 

The material component for casting this 
spell is a potion of heroism (or superhero- 
ism) that the wizard must consume during 
the course of uttering the spell. 


Transmute Water to Dust (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration; Permanent 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: None (special) 


When this spell is cast, the subject area 
instantly undergoes a change from liquid to 
powdery dust. Note that if the water is 
already muddy, the area of effect is doubled, 
while if wet mud is being transmuted, the 
area of effect is quadrupled. If water 
remains in contact with the transmuted 
dust, the former quickly soaks the latter, 
turning the dust into silty mud, if a suffi- 
cient quantity of water exists to do so, oth- 
erwise soaking or dampening the dust 
accordingly. 

Only liquid actually in the area of effect 
at the moment of spellcasting is affected. 
Liquids that are only partially water are 
affected only insofar as the actual water 
content is concerned, except that potions 
containing water are rendered useless. Liv- 
ing creatures are unaffected, except for 
those native to the elemental plane of Water. 
Such creatures receive saving throws vs. 
spell. Failure inflicts 1d6 points of damage 
per caster level upon the subject, while suc- 
cess means the creature receives but half 
damage. Only one such creature can be 
affected by any single casting of this spell, 
regardless of the creature's size or the size of 
the spell’s area of effect. 

The reverse of the spell is simply a very 
high-powered create water spell that 
requires a pinch of normal dust as an addi- 
tional material component. 


For either usage of the spell, other compo- 
nents required are diamond dust of at least 
500 gp value and a bit of seashell. 


True Seeing (Divination) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 60-foot light range 
Saving Throw: None 


When the wizard employs this spell, he 
confers upon the recipient the ability to see 
all things as they actually are. The spell pen- 
etrates normal and magical darkness. Secret 
doors become plain. The exact location of 
displaced things is obvious. Invisible things 
become visible. Illusions and apparitions 
are seen through. Polymorphed, changed, 
or enchanted objects are apparent. (The real 
form appears translucently superimposed 
on the apparent form: a gold dragon poly- 
morphed to human form would appear 
human with a ghostly dragon looming over 
the human form.) Unlike the clerical version 
of this spell, the recipient cannot determine 
alignment. The recipient can focus his 
vision to see into the Ethereal plane or the 
bordering areas of adjacent planes. The 
range of vision conferred is 60 feet. True see- 
ing does not penetrate solid objects; it in no 
way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. 
Furthermore, the spell effects cannot be 
enhanced with magic. 

The spell requires an ointment for the 
eyes that is made from a very rare mush- 
room powder, saffron, and fat. It costs no 
less than 300 gp per use and must be aged for 
1d6 months. 


Veil (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: None 

The veil spell enables the wizard to instantly 
change the appearance of his surroundings 
and party or to create hallucinatory terrain so 
as to fool even the most clever creatures unless 
they have the true seeing spell, a gem of see- 
ing, or similar magical aid. The veil can make 
a sumptuous room seem a filthy den and even 
tactile impressions conform to the visual illu- 
sion. Likewise, a party might be made to 
resemble a mixed band of brownies, pixies, 
and faeries led by a treant. If hallucinatory ter- 
rain is created, touch does not cause it to van-

Seventh-Level Spells 


Banishment (Abjuration) 


Range: 20 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Instantaneous 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures 
in a 60-foot radius 

Saving Throw: Special 


A banishment spell enables the caster to 
force some extraplanar creature out of the 
caster’s home plane. The effect is instantane- 
ous, and the subject cannot come back with- 
out some special summoning or means of 
egress from its own plane to the one from 
which it was banished. Up to 2 Hit Dice or 
levels of creature per caster level can be ban- 
ished. 

The caster must both name the type of 
creature(s) to be sent away and give its 
name and title as well, if any. In any event, 
the creature’s magic resistance must be 
defeated for the spell to be effective. 

The material components of the spell are 
substances harmful, hateful, or opposed to 
the nature of the subject(s) of the spell. For 
every such substance included in the cast- 
ing, the subject creature(s) loses 5% from its 
magic resistance and suffers a —2 penalty to 
its saving throw vs. spell. For example, if 
iron, holy water, sunstone, and a sprig of 
rosemary were used in casting a banishment 
upon a being that hates those things , its sav- 
ing throw versus the spell would be made 


with a —8 penalty (four substances times 
the factor of —2). Special items, such as hair 
from the tail of a ki-rin, or couat) feathers, 
could also be added to bring the factor up to 
—3or —4 per item, In contrast, a titan’s hair 
or mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower 
the factor to —1 with respect to the same 
creature. If the subject creature successfully 
rolls its saving throw vs. spell, the caster is 
stung by a backlash of energy, suffers 2d6 
points of damage, and is stunned for one 
round, 


Bigby’s Grasping Hand (Evocation) 


‘Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving, Throw: None 


Bigby\s grasping hand is a superior ver- 
sion of the 6th-level Bigby’s forceful hand. It 
create: & man-sized (five feet) to gar- 
gantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that appears 
and grasps a creature designated by the 
caster, regardless of what the spellcaster 
does or how the opponent tries to escape it. 
The grasping hand can hold motionless a 
creature or object of up to 1,000 pounds 
weight, slow movement to 10 feet per round 
if the creature weighs between 1,000 and 
4,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if 
the creature weighs up to 16,000 pounds. 
The hand itself inflicts no damage. The 
grasping hand has an Armor Class of 0, has 
as many hit points as its caster in full health, 
and vanishes when destroyed. The caster 
can order it to release a trapped opponent or 
can dismiss it on command. 

The material component is a leather 
glove. 


Charm Plants (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The charm plants spell enables the spell- 
caster to bring under command vegetable 
life forms and communicate with them. 
These plants obey instructions to the best of 
their ability. The spell will charm plants in a 
30’ X 10’ area. While the spell does not en- 
dow the vegetation with new abilities, it 
does enable the wizard to command the 
plants to use whatever they have in order to 
fulfill his instructions; if the plants in the 
area of effect do have special or unusual 
abilities, these are used as commanded by 
the wizard. For example, this spell can gen- 
erally duplicate the effects of the 1st-level 
priest spell entangle, if the caster desires. 


Wizard Spells (7th Level) 


The saving throw applies only to intelligent 
plants, and it is made with a —4 penalty to 
the die roll. 

The material components of the spell are 
a pinch of humus, a drop of water, and a 
twig or leaf. 


Control Undead (Necromancy) 


Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3d4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1d6 undead 

Saving Throw: Special 


This spell enables the wizard to command 
1d6 undead creatures for a short period of 
time. Upon casting the spell, the wizard se- 
lects one point within range of the spell. 
Those undead nearest to this point are af- 
fected, until either undead equal in Hit Dice 
to the caster's level or six undead are af- 
fected. Undead with 3 Hit Dice or less are 
automatically controlled. Those of greater 
Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. 
spell, which if successful negates the attempt 
to control that creature. Regardless of the 
success or failure of the saving throw, each 
creature required to make a check counts to- 
ward the Hit Dice limit of the spell. 

Those creatures under the control of the 
wizard can be commanded by the caster if 
they are within hearing range. There is no 
telepathic communication between the 
caster and the controlled undead. There is 
no language requirement either. Even if 
communication is impossible, the con- 
trolled undead do not attack the spellcaster. 
At the end of the spell, the controlled un- 
dead revert to their normal behaviors. 
Those not mindless will remember the con- 
trol exerted by the wizard. 

The material component for this spell is a 
small piece each of bone and raw meat. 


Delayed Blast Fireball (Evocation) 


Range: 100 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe 
Saving Throw: 1/2 


This spell creates a fireball, witha +1 bo- 
nus to each of its dice of damage, which re- 
leases its blast anywhere from instantly to 
five rounds later, according to the command 
given by the wizard. In other respects, the 
spell is the same as the 3rd-level spell fire- 
ball.

Drawmij’s Instant Summons 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: Infinite + special 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 small object 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard tele- 
ports some desired item from virtually any 
location directly to his hand. The single ob- 
ject can be no longer in any dimension than 
a sword, can have no more weight than a 
shield (about eight pounds), and it must be 
nonliving. To prepare this spell, the wizard 
must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 gp 
value in his hand and utter all but the final 
word of the conjuration. He then must 
crush this gem and utter the final word. The 
desired item is then transported instantly 
into the spellcaster’s right or left hand as he 
desires. The item must have been previously 
touched during the initial incantation and 
specifically named; only that particular 
item is summoned by the spell. The special 
gem used to summon the item has a magi- 
cally created inscription naming the item to 
be summoned. The inscription is invisible 
and unreadable, except by means of a read 
magic spell, to all but the wizard who cast 
the summons. 

If the item is in the possession of another 
creature, the spell does not work, and the 
caster knows who the possessor is and 
roughly where he, she, or it is located when 
the summons is cast. Items can be sum- 
moned from other planes of existence, but 
only if such items are not in the possession 
(not necessarily the physical grasp) of an- 
other creature. For each level of experience 
above the 14th, the wizard is able to sum- 
mon a desired item from one plane farther 
removed from the plane he is in at the time 
the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th 
level, two planes away at 15th, etc.) Thus, a 
wizard of 16th level could cast the spell even 
if the desired item was on the second layer of 
one of the outer planes, but at 14th level the 
wizard would be able to summon the item 
only if it were no farther than one of the in- 
ner planes, the Ethereal plane, or the Astral 
plane (see Manual of the Planes). Note that 
special wards or barriers, or factors that 
block the teleport or plane shift spells, may 
also block the operation of this spell. Ob- 
jects in Leomund's secret chest cannot be re- 
covered by using this spell. 

Note: If the item is wizard marked, it can 
be summoned from anywhere on the same 
plane unless special local conditions apply. 
Furthermore, the details of the location of 
the item are more specific, and the item is 
more easily traceable with other types of 
scrying magic. 


Wizard Spells (7th Level) 


Duo-Dimension (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: The caster 

Saving Throw: None 


A duo-dimension spell causes the caster 
to have only two dimensions, height and 
width, but no depth. He is thus invisible 
when turned sideways. This invisibility can 
be detected only by means of a true seeing 
spell or similar methods. In addition, the 
duo-dimensional wizard can pass through 
the thinnest of spaces as long as these have 
the proper height—going through the space 
between a door and its frame is a simple 
matter. The wizard can perform all actions 
normally. He can turn and become invisible, 
move in this state, and appear again next 
round and cast a spell, disappearing on the 
following round. 

Note that when turned, the wizard cannot 
be affected by any form of attack, but when 
visible, he is subject to double the amount of 
damage normal for an attack form, e.g., a 
dagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of 
damage if it struck a duo-dimensional wiz- 
ard. Furthermore, the wizard has a portion 
of his existence in the Astral plane when the 
spell is in effect, and he is subject to possible 
notice by creatures there. If noticed, it is 
25% probable that the wizard is pulled en- 
tirely into the Astral plane by any attack 
from an astral creature. Such an attack (and 
any subsequent attack received on the As- 
tral plane) inflicts normal damage. 

The material components of this spell are 
a flat ivory likeness of the spellcaster (which 
must be of finest workmanship, gold fili- 
greed, and enameled and gem-studded at an 
average cost of 500 to 1,000 gp) and a strip 
of parchment. As the spell is uttered, the 
parchment is given a half twist and joined at 
the ends. The figurine is then passed 
through the parchment loop, and both dis- 
appear forever. 


Finger of Death (Necromancy) 


Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The finger of death spell snuffs out the 
victim's life force. If successful, the victim 
can be neither raised nor resurrected. In ad- 
dition, in human subjects the spell initiates 
changes to the body such that after three 
days the caster can, by means of a special 
ceremony costing not less than 1,000 gp plus 
500 gp per body, animate the corpse as a ju- 
ju zombie under the control of the caster. 


The changes can be reversed before anima- 
tion by a limited wish or similar spell cast di- 
rectly upon the body, while a full wish 
restores the subject to life. 

The caster utters the finger of death spell 
incantation, points his index finger at the 
creature to be slain, and unless the victim 
succeeds in a saving throw vs. spell, death 
occurs. A creature successfully saving still 
receives 2d8+1 points of damage. If the 
subject dies of damage, no internal changes 
occur and the victim can then be revived 
normally. 


Forcecage (Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards per 2 levels 
Components: V, S + special 
Duration: 6 turns + 1/level 
Casting Time: 3-4 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: None 


This powerful spell enables the caster to 
bring into being a cube of force, but it is un- 
like the magical item of that name in one im- 
portant respect: The forcecage does not 
have solid walls of force; it has alternating 
bands of force with 1/2-inch gaps between. 
Thus, it is truly a cage rather than an en- 
closed space with solid walls. Creatures 
within the area of effect of the spell are 
caught and contained unless they are able to 
pass through the openings—and of course 
all spells and breath weapons can pass 
through the gaps in the bars of force of the 
forcecage. 

A creature with magic resistance has a 
single attempt to pass through the walls of 
the cage. If the resistance check is success- 
ful, the creature escapes. If it fails, then the 
creature is caged. Note that a successful 
check does not destroy the cage, nor does it 
enable other creatures (save familiars) to 
flee with the escaping creature. The force- 
cage is also unlike the solid-walled protect- 
ive device, cube of force, in that it can be 
gotten rid of only by means of a dispel 
magic spell or by the expiration of the spell. 

By means of special preparation at the 
time of memorization, a forcecage spell can 
be altered to a forcecube spell. The cube cre- 
ated is 10 feet ona side, and the spell then re- 
sembles that of a cube of force in all respects 
save that of the differences between a cast 
spell and the magic of a device, including 
the methods of defeating its power. 

Although the actual casting of either ap- 
plication of the spell requires no material 
component, the study required to commit it 
to memory does demand that the wizard 
powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp 
value, using the diamond dust to trace the 
outlines of the cage or cube he desires to cre- 
ate via spellcasting at some later time. Thus, 
in memorization, the diamond dust is em- 
ployed and expended, for upon completion 


184 


of study, the wizard must then toss the dust 
into the air and it will disappear. 


Limited Wish (Conjuration/Summoning, 
Invocation/Evocation) 


Range: Unlimited 
Components: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


The limited wish is a very potent but diffi- 
cult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only 
partially or for a limited duration, the utter- , 
ance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of 
the past, present, or future might be altereg 
(but possibly only for the wizard unless ‘the 
wording of the spell is most carefully stated) 
in some limited manner. The use of a limited 
wish will not substantially change major re- 
alities, nor will it bring wealth or experience 
merely by asking. The spell can, for exam- 
ple, restore some hit points (or all hie points 
for a limited duration) lost by the wizard. It 
can reduce opponent hit probabilities or 
damage, increase duration of some magical 
effect, cause a creature to be favorably dis- 
posed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of 7th 
level or less, and so on (see the wish spell). 
Greedy desires usually end in disaster for 
the wisher, Casting time is based on the time 
spent preparing the wording for the spell 
(clever players decide what they want to say 
before using the spell). Normally the casting 
time is one round (most of it being taken up 
by deciding what to say). Casting this spell 
ages the caster one year per 100 years of reg- 
ular life span. 


Mass Invisibility 
(Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This is a more extensive adaptation of the 
invisibility spell for battlefield use. It can 
hide creatures in a 60 yd. X 60 yd. area; up 
to 300 to 400 man-sized creatures, 30 to 40 
giants, or six to eight large dragons. The ef- 
fect is mobile with the unit and is broken 
when the unit attacks. Individuals leaving 
the unit become visible. The wizard can end 
this spell upon command. 

The material component of the mass in- 
visibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of 
gum arabic, the former encased in the latter. 


Wizard Spells (7th Level) 


Monster Summoning V 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 70 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- 
ster summoning | spell, except that this spell 
summons 1d3 Sth-level monsters. These ap- 
pear within spell range and attack the cast- 
er's opponents until either he commands 
them to cease, the spell duration expires, or 
the monsters are slain. These creatures do 
not check morale, and they vanish when 
slain. If no opponent exists to fight, sum- 
ntoned monsters can, if the wizard can com- 
municate with them, and if they are 
physically capable, perform other services 
for the summoning wizard. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny, bag and a small (not necessarily lit) 
candle. 


Mordenkainen’s Magnificent 
Mansion (Alteration, Conjuration) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 7 rounds 

Area of Effect: 300 sq. ft./level 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard con- 
jures up an extradimensional dwelling, en- 
trance to which can be gained only at a 
single point of space on the plane from 
which the spell was cast. From the entry 
point, those creatures observing the area see 
only a faint shimmering in the air, in an area 
four feet wide and eight feet high. The caster 
of the spell controls entry to the mansion, 
and the portal is shut and made invisible be- 
hind him when he enters. He may open it 
again from his own side at will. Once ob- 
servers have passed beyond the entrance, 
they behold a magnificent foyer and numer- 
ous chambers beyond. The place is fur- 
nished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to 
serve a nine-course banquet to as many 
dozens of people as the spellcaster has levels 
of experience. There is a staff of near- 
transparent servants, liveried and obedient, 
there to wait upon all who enter. The atmos- 
phere is clean, fresh, and warm. 

Since the place can be entered only 
through its special portal, outside condi- 
tions do not affect the mansion, nor do con- 
ditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. 
Rest and relaxation within the place is nor- 
mal, but the food is not. It seems excellent 
and quite filling as long as one is within the 
place. Once outside, however, its effects dis- 


appear immediately, and if those resting 
have not eaten real food within a reasonable 
time span, ravenous hunger strikes. Failure 
to eat normal food immediately results in 
the onset of fatigue or starvation penalties 
as decided by the DM. 

The material components of this spell are 
a miniature portal carved from ivory, a 
small piece of polished marble, and a tiny 
silver spoon. These are utterly destroyed 
when the spell is cast. 

(It is worth mentioning that this spell has 
been used in conjunction with a normal por- 
tal, as well as with illusion magic. There is 
evidence that the design and interior of the 
space created can be altered to suit the cast- 
er's wishes.) 


Mordenkainen’s Sword (Evocation) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


Upon casting this spell, the wizard brings 
into being a shimmering, sword-like plane 
of force. The spellcaster is able to mentally 
wield this weapon (to the exclusion of all ac- 
tivities other than movement), causing it to 
move and strike as if it were being used by a 
fighter. The basic chance for Mor- 
denkainen’s sword to hit is the same as the 
chance for a sword wielded by a fighter of 
one-half the level of the spellcaster, e.g., if 
cast by a 14th-level wizard, the weapon has 
the same hit probability as a sword wielded 
by a 7th-level fighter. The sword has no 
magical attack bonuses, but it can hit nearly 
any sort of opponent, even those normally 
struck only by +3 weapons or those astral, 
ethereal,or out of phase. It hits any Armor 
Class on a roll of 19 or 20. It inflicts 5d4 
points of damage to opponents of man-size 
or smaller, and 5d6 to opponents larger than 
man-sized. It lasts until the spell duration 
expires, a dispel magic is used successfully 
upon it, or its caster no longer desires it. 

The material component is a miniature 
platinum sword with a grip and pommel of 
copper and zinc, which costs 500 gp to con- 
struct, and which disappears after the spell’s 
completion. 


Phase Door (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V 
Duration: 1 usage/2 levels 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the wizard attunes 
his body, and a section of wall is affected as 
if by a passwall spell. The phase door is in- 


visible to all creatures save the spellcaster, 
and only he can use the space or passage the 
spell creates, disappearing when the phase 
door is entered, and appearing when it is ex- 
ited. If the caster desires, one other creature 
of man size or less can be taken through the 
door; this counts as two uses of the door. 
The door does not pass light, sound, or spell 
effects, nor can the caster see through it 
without using it. Thus the spell can provide 
an escape route, though certain creatures, 
such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. 
A gem of true seeing and similar magic will 
reveal the presence of a phase door but will 
not allow its use. 

The phase door lasts for one usage for 
every two levels of experience of the spell- 
caster. It can be dispelled only by a casting 
of dispel magic from a higher level wizard, 
or by several lower level wizards, casting in 
concert, whose combined levels of experi- 
ence are more than double that of the wiz- 
ard who cast the spell (this is the only 
instance in which combining dispel effects 
can be done). 

Rumor has it that this spell has been 
adapted by a certain powerful wizard (or 
wizards) to create renewable (or permanent) 
portals, which may (or may not) be keyed 
to specific individuals (henchmen) or items 
(such as rings). 


Power Word, Stun 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


When a power word, stun spell is uttered, 
any creature of the mage’s choice is 
stunned—reeling and unable to think coher- 
ently or to act—for a duration dependent on 
its current hit points. Of course, the wizard 
must be facing the creature, and the creature 
must be within the range of five yards per 
experience level of the caster, Creatures 
with 1 to 30 hit points are stunned for 4d4 
rounds,those with 31 to 60 hit points are 
stunned for 2d4 rounds, those with 61 to 90 
hit points are stunned for 1d4 rounds, and 
creatures with over 90 hit points are not af- 
fected. Note that if a creature is weakened 
so that its hit points are below its usual max- 
imum, the current number of hit points is 
used. 


Prismatic Spray

Casting Time: 7 


Wizard Spells (7th Level)

Reverse Gravity (Alteration) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 30 feet X 30 feet 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell reverses gravity in the area of 
effect, causing all unattached objects and 
creatures within it to “fall” upward. The 
reverse gravity lasts as long as the caster 
desires or until the spell expires. If some 
solid object is encountered in this “fall,” the 
object strikes it in the same manner as it 
would during a normal downward fall. At 
the end of the spell duration, the affected 
objects and creatures fall downward. As the 
spell affects an area, objects tens, hundreds, 
or even thousands of feet in the air above 
the area can be affected. 

The material components of this spell are 
a lodestone and iron filings. 


Sequester 
(Iusion/Phantasm, Abjuration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 week + 1 day/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 2-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: Special 


When cast, this spell not only prevents 
detection and location spells from working 
to detect or locate the objects affected by the 
sequester spell, it also renders the affected 


object(s) invisible to any form of sight or 
seeing. Thus, a sequester spell can mask a 
secret door, a treasure vault, or whatever. 
Of course, it does not render the subject 
proof from tactile discovery or from 
devices, such as a robe of eyes or a gem of 
seeing. If cast upon a creature not desiring 
to be affected, a normal saving throw vs. 
spell is given. Living creatures (and even 
undead types) affected by a sequester spell 
become comatose and are effectively in a 
state of suspended animation until the spell 
wears off or is dispelled. 

The material components of the spell are 
a basilisk eyelash, gum arabic, and a dram 
of whitewash. 


Shadow Walk (Illusion, Enchantment) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 6 turns/level 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


In order to use the shadow walk spell, the 
wizard must be in an area of heavy 
shadows. The caster and any creature he 
touches are then transported to the edge of 
the Prime Material plane where it borders 
the plane of Shadow. In this region the wiz- 
ard can move at a rate of up to seven miles 
per turn, moving normally on the borders 
of the plane of Shadow but much more rap- 
idly relative to the Prime Material plane. 
Thus rapid travel can be accomplished by 
moving in the plane of Shadow and then 


186 


stepping from the plane of Shadow to the 
Prime Material plane. The wizard knows 
where he will come out on the Prime Materi- 
al plane. 

The shadow walk spell can also be used to 
travel to other planes that border on the 
plane of Shadow, but this requires the 
potentially perilous transit of the plane of 
Shadow to arrive at a border with another 
plane of reality. Any creatures touched by 
the wizard when shadow walk is cast also 
make the transition to the borders of the 
plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow 
the wizard, wander off into Shadowland, or 
stumble back into the Prime Material plane 
(50% chance for either result if they are lost 
or abandoned by the wizard). Creatures 
unwilling to accompany the wizard into the ;” 
plane of Shadow get a saving throw, negat 
ing the effect if successful. 


Simulacrum (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the wizard is able 
to create a duplicate of any creature. The 
duplicate appears to be exactly the same as 
the original, but there are differences: the 
simulacrum has only 51% to 60% (50% + 
1d10%) of the hit points of the real creature, 
there are personality differences, there are 
areas of knowledge that the duplicate does 
not have, and a detect magic spell will 
instantly reveal it as a simulacrum, as will a 
true seeing spell. At all times the simula- 
crum remains under the absolute command 
of the wizard who created it. No special tele- 
pathic link exists, so command must be 
exercised in some other manner. The spell 
creates the form of the creature, but it is 
only a zombie-like creation. A reincarna- 
tion spell must be used to give the duplicate 
a vital force, and a limited wish spell must 
be used to empower the duplicate with 40% 
to 65% (35% + 5 to 30%) of the knowledge 
and personality of the original. The level, if 
any, of the simulacrum is from 20% to 50% 
of that of the original creature. 

The duplicate creature is formed from ice 
or snow. The spell is cast over the rough 
form and some piece of the creature to be 
duplicated must be placed inside the snow 
or ice. Additionally, the spell requires pow- 
dered ruby. 

The simulacrum has no ability to become 
more powerful: it cannot increase its level or 
abilities. If destroyed, it reverts to snow and 
melts into nothingness. Damage to the simula- 
crum can be repaired by a complex process 
requiring at least one day, 100 gp per hit point, 
and a fully equipped laboratory. 


Wizard Spells (7th Level) 


Spell Turning (Abjuration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Up to 3 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


This powerful abjuration causes spells 
cast against the wizard to rebound on the 
original caster. This includes spells cast 
from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, 
but specifically excludes the following: area 
effects that are not centered directly upon 
the protected wizard, spell effects delivered 
by touch, and spell effects from devices such 

é wands, staves, etc. Thus a light spell cast 

t. blind the protected wizard could be 

tuned back upon and possibly blind the 

caste, while the same spell would be unaf- 
teactecif cast to light an area within which 
the jorctected wizard is standing. 

Fromseven to ten spell levels are affected 
by the turning. The exact number is secretly 
rolled by the DM; the player never knows 
for certain how effective the spell is. 

A spell may be only partially turned— 
divide the number of remaining levels that 
can be turned by the spell level of the incom- 
ing spell to see what fraction of the effect is 
turned—the remainder affects the caster. 
For example, if an incoming fireball is cen- 
tered on a wizard with one level of turning 
left. This means that 2/3 of the fireball af- 
fects the protected wizard, '/s affects the 
caster, and each is the center of a fireball ef- 
fect. If the rolled damage is 40 points, the 
protected wizard receives 27 points of dam- 
age and the caster suffers 13. Both (and any 
creatures in the respective areas) can roll 
saving throws vs. spell for half damage. 
Partially turned hold or paralysis spells will 
slow those who are 50% or more affected. 

If the protected wizard and a spellcasting 
attacker both have spell turning effects op- 
erating, a resonating field is created that has 
the following effects: 


D100 

Roll Effect 

01-70 Spell drains away without effect 

71-80 Spell affects both equally at full 
damage 

81-97 Both turning effects are rendered 
non-functional for 1d4 turns 

98-00 Both casters go through a rift 


into the Positive Material plane 


The material component for the spell is a 
small silver mirror. 


Statue (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 hour/level 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: Special 


When a statue spell is cast, the wizard or 
other creature is apparently turned to solid 
stone, along with any garments and equip- 
ment worn or carried. The initial transfor- 
mation from flesh to stone requires one full 
round after the spell is cast. During this ini- 
tial transformation, the creature must roll a 
saving throw of 82% or less, with —1 de- 
ducted from the dice roll for each point of 
Constitution, so an 18 Constitution grants 
certain success. Failure indicates system 
shock and death. Thereafter the creature 
can withstand any inspection and appear to 
be a stone statue, although a faint magic is 
detected from the stone if it is checked for. 

Despite being in this condition, the petri- 
fied individual can see, hear, and smell nor- 
mally. Feeling is limited to those sensations 
that can affect the granite-hard substance of 
the individual's body—i.e., chipping is 
equal to a slight wound, but breaking off 
one of the statue's arms is serious damage. 

The individual under the magic of a 
statue spell can return to his normal state in- 
stantly, act, and then return to the statue 
state, if he so desires, as long as the spell du- 
ration is in effect. 

The material components of this spell are 
lime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an 
iron bar, such as a nail or spike. 


Teleport Without Error (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell is similar to the teleport spell. 
The caster is able to transport himself, along 
with the material weight noted for a teleport 
spell, to any known location in his home 
plane with no chance for error. The spell 
also enables the caster to travel to other 
planes of existence, but any such plane is, at 
best, “studied carefully.” This assumes that 
the caster has, in fact, actually been to the 
plane and carefully perused an area for an 
eventual teleportation without error spell. 
The table for the teleport spell is used, with 
the caster’s knowledge of the area to which 
transportation is desired used to determine 
chance of error. (Exception: See the 9th- 
level wizard spell, succor.) The caster can 
do nothing else the round that he appears 
from a teleport. 


187 


Vanish (Alteration) 
Range: Touch 


Components: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 object 
Saving Throw: None 


When the wizard employs this spell, he 
causes an object to vanish (i.e., to be tele- 
ported as if by a teleport spell) if it weighs 
no more than 50 pounds per caster level. 
Thus a 14th-level caster can vanish, and 
cause to reappear at a desired location, an 
object up to 700 pounds in weight. The max- 
imum volume of material that can be af- 
fected is three cubic feet per level of 
experience. Thus, both weight and volume 
limit the spell. An object that exceeds either 
limitation is unaffected and the spell fails. 

If desired, a vanished object can be placed 
deep within the Ethereal plane. In this case, 
the point from which the object vanished re- 
mains faintly magical until the item is re- 
trieved. A successful dispel magic spell cast 
on the point will bring the vanished item 
back from the Ethereal plane. Note that 
creatures and magical forces cannot be 
made to vanish. 

There is a 1% chance that a vanished item 
will be disintegrated instead. There is also a 
1% chance that a creature from the Ethereal 
plane is able to gain access to the Prime Ma- 
terial plane through the vanished item’s con- 
nection, 


Vision (Divination) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


At such time as the wizard wishes to gain 
supernatural guidance, he casts a vision 
spell, calling upon whatever power he de- 
sires aid from, and asking the question for 
which a vision is to be given in answer. Two 
six-sided dice are rolled. If they total 2 to 6, 
the power is annoyed and will cause the wiz- 
ard, by an ultra-powerful geas or quest, to 
do some service, and no questions are an- 
swered. If the dice total 7 to 9, the power is 
indifferent, and some minor vision, possi- 
bly unrelated to the question, is given. A 
score of 10 or better indicates that the vision 
is granted. 

The material component of the spell is the 
sacrifice of something valued by the spell- 
caster or by the power supplicated. The 
more precious the sacrifice, the better the 
chance of spell success. A very precious 
item grants a bonus of +1 on the dice, one 
that is extremely precious adds +2, and a 
priceless item adds +3. 


Eighth-Level Spells 


Antipathy-Sympathy 
(Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 2 hours/level 
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell allows the wizard to set certain 
vibrations to emanate from an object or 
location that tend to either repel or attract a 
specific type of intelligent creature or char- 
acters of a particular alignment. The wizard 
must decide which effect is desired with 
regard to what creature type or alignment 
before beginning the spellcasting, for the 
components of each application differ. The 
spell cannot be cast upon living creatures. 

Antipathy: This spell causes the affected 
creature or alignment type to feel an over- 
powering urge to leave the area or to not 
touch the affected item. If a saving throw 
vs. spell is successful, the creature can stay 
in the area or touch the item, but the crea- 
ture will feel very uncomfortable, and a per- 
sistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss 
of 1 point of Dexterity per round (for the 
spell's duration), subject to a maximum loss 
of 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3. 
Failure to save vs. spell forces the being to 
abandon the area or item, shunning it per- 
manently and never willingly returning it 
until the spell is removed or expires. 

The material component for this applica- 
tion of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in 
vinegar. 

Sympathy: By casting the sympathy 
application of the spell, the wizard can 
cause a particular type of creature or align- 
ment of character to feel elated and pleased 
to be in an area or touching or possessing an 


object or item. The desire to stay in the area 
or touch the object is overpowering. Unless 
a saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled 
the creature or character will stay or refuse 
to release the object. If the saving throw is 
successful, the creature or character is 
released from the enchantment, but a subse- 
quent saving throw must be made 1d6 turns 
later. If this saving throw fails, the affected 
creature will return to the area or object. 

The material components of this spell are 
1,000 gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop 
of honey. 

Note that the particular type of creature 
to be affected must be named specifically, 
e.g., red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lam- 
masu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Likewise, 
the specific alignment must be named, e.g., 
chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, 
true neutral, etc. 

If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot 
cube can be enchanted per experience level 
of the caster. If an object or item is enchant- 
ed, only that single thing can be enchanted; 
affected creatures or characters save vs. the 
spell with a —2 penalty. 


Bigby’s Clenched Fist (Evocation) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The Bighy' 's clenched fist spell brings forth 
a huge, ied hand that is balled into 
a fist. This magical member is under the 
mental control of the spellcaster, who can 
cause it to strike one opponent each round. 
No concentration is required once the spell 
is cast. The clenched fist never misses, but it 
can only strike as directed by the caster. 
Thus it can be fooled by invisibility or other 
methods of concealment and misdirection. 
The effectiveness of its blows varies from 
round to round. 


D20 

Roll Result 

1-12 glancing blow—1d6 hp 

13-16 solid punch—2d6 hp 

17-19 hard punch—3dé6 hp and opponent 
is stunned next round 

20 Crushing blow*—4d6 hp and 
opponent is stunned for next three 
rounds 

° The wizard adds +4 to the die rolls of 
subsequent attacks if the opponent is 
stunned, as the opponent is not capable of 
dodging or defending against the attack 
effectively. 

The fist has an Armor Class of 0, and is 
destroyed by damage equal to the hit points 
of its caster at full health. 

The material component of this spell is a 


leather glove and a small device consisting 
of four rings joined so as to form a slightly 
curved line, with an “I” upon which the bot- 
toms of the rings rest, the whole fashioned 
of an alloy of copper and zinc. 


Binding (Enchantment, Evocation) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 

A binding spell creates a magical restraint 
to hold a creature, usually from another 
plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures 
must be confined by a circular diagram: 
other creatures can be physically confinec 


The duration of the spell depends upon he . 


form of the binding and the level of the asix- 
er(s), as well as the length of time the pelil is 
actually uttered. The components vary 
according to the form of the spell, but esi 
include a continuous chanting utterance 
read from the scroll or book page giving the 
spell; gestures appropriate to the form of 
binding; and materials such as miniature 
chains of special metal (silver for lycan- 
thropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest 
sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great 
size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the sub- 
ject creature), and a vellum depiction or 
carved statuette of the subject to be cap- 
tured. 

Magic resistance applies unless the sub- 
ject’s true name is used. A saving throw is 
not applicable as long as the experience level 
of the caster is at least twice as great as the 
Hit Dice of the subject. The caster’s level can 
be augmented by one-third of the levels of 
each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, 
and by one level for each assistant of 4th 
through 8th level. No more than six other 
wizards can assist with this spell. If the cast- 
er's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the 
subject, then the subject gains a saving 
throw vs. spell, modified by the form of 
binding being attempted. The various forms 
of binding are these: 

Chaining: The subject is confined by 
restraints that generate an antipathy affect- 
ing all creatures who approach the subject, 
except the caster. Duration is as long as one 
year per level of the caster(s). The subject of 
this form of binding (as well as in the slum- 
ber and bound slumber versions) remains 
within the restraining barrier. 

Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon 
the subject for a duration of up to one year 
per level of the caster(s). 

Bound Slumber: A combination of chain- 
ing and slumber that lasts for up to one 
month per level of the caster(s). 

Hedged Prison: The subject is transported 
to or otherwise brought within a confined 


~ 


Wizard Spells (8th Level) 


area from which it cannot wander by any 
means until freed. The spell remains until 
the magical hedge is somehow broken. 
Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to 
to some noncorporeal form, save for 
its head or face. The binding is permanent 
until some prescribed act frees the subject. 
Minimus Containment: The subject is 
shrunken to a height of one inch or even less 
and held within the hedged prison of some 
gem or similar object. The subject of a mini- 
mus containment, metamorphosis, or 
hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of 


magic. 

The type of binding does not modify the 
saving throw for the chaining form of the 
spell. Slumber allows the subject a +1 

bnus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged 

prion a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 

bons, and minimus containment a +5 
bony. to the saving throw. However, if the 
subject is magically weakened, the referee 
can assign a —1, —2, or even —4 penalty to 
the saving throw. A successful saving throw 
enables the subject to burst its bonds and do 
as it pleases. 

A binding spell can be renewed in the case 
of the first three forms of the spell, for the 
subject does not have the opportunity to 
break the bonds. (If anything has caused a 
weakening of a chaining or slumber version, 
such as attempts to contact the subject or 
magically touch it, a normal saving throw 
applies to the renewal of the spell.) Other- 
wise, after one year, and each year thereaf- 
ter, the subject gains a normal saving throw 
vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the 
binding spell is broken and the creature is 
free. 


Clone (Necromancy) 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell creates a duplicate of a human, 
demihuman, or humanoid creature. This 
clone is in most respects the duplicate of the 
individual, complete to the level of experi- 
ence, memories, etc. However, the dupli- 
cate really is the person, so that if the 
original and a duplicate exist at the same 
time, each knows of the other's existence; 
and the original person and the clone will 
each desire to do away with the other, for 
such an alter-ego is unbearable to both. If 
one cannot destroy the other, one will go 
insane (90% likely to be the clone) and 
destroy itself, or possibly (2% chance) both 
will become mad and destroy themselves. 
These events nearly always occur within 
one week of the dual existence. Note that 
the clone is the person as he existed at the 


time at which the flesh was taken, and all 
subsequent knowledge, experience, etc., is 
totally unknown to the clone. The clone is a 
physical duplicate, and possessions of the 
original are another matter entirely. A clone 
takes 2d4 months to grow, and only after 
that time is dual existence established. 
Finally, the clone has one less Constitution 
point than the body it was cloned from, and 
the cloning fails if the clone would have a 
Constitution of 0. 

The material component of the spell is a 
small piece of the flesh from the person to be 
duplicated. 

The DM may, in addition, add other stip- 
ulations to the success of a cloning effort, 
requiring that some trace of life must remain 
in the flesh sample, that some means of stor- 
ing and preserving the sample must be 
devised and maintained, etc. 


Demand 
(Evocation, Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: Special 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell is very much like the Sth-level 
wizard spell sending, allowing a brief con- 
tact with a far distant creature, except that 
the message can also contain a suggestion 
(see 3rd-level wizard spell), which the sub- 
ject will do its best to carry out if it fails its 
saving throw vs. spell, with a —2 penalty. 
Of course, if the message is impossible or 
meaningless according to the circumstances 
that exist for the subject at the time the 
demand comes, the message is understood 
but no saving throw is necessary and the 
suggestion is ineffective. 

The caster must be familiar with the crea- 
ture contacted and must know its name and 
appearance well. If the creature in question 
is not in the same plane of existence as the 
spellcaster, there is a base 5% chance that 
the demand does not arrive. Local condi- 
tions on other planes may worsen this 
chance considerably at the option of the 
DM. The demand, if received, will be 
understood even if the creature has an Intel- 
ligence ability score as low as 1 (animal 
Intelligence). Creatures of demigod status 
or higher can choose to come or not, as they 
please. 

The demand message to the creature must 
be 25 words or less, including the sugges- 
tion. The creature can also give a short reply 
immediately. 

The material components of the spell are 
a pair of cylinders, each open at one end, 
connected by a thin piece of copper wire and 
some small part of the subject creature—a 
hair, bit of nail, etc.

Glassteel (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Object touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The glassteel spell turns normal, non- 
magical crystal or glass into a transparent 
substance that has the tensile strength and 
unbreakability of actual steel. Only a rela- 
tively small volume of material can be 
affected, a maximum weight of 10 pounds 
per level of experience of the spellcaster, and 
it must form one whole object. The Armor 
Class of the substance is 1. 

The material components of this spell are 
a small piece of glass and a small piece of 
steel. 


Incendiary Cloud 
(Alteration, Evocation) 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, 5, M 

Duration: 4 rounds + 1d6 rounds 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: 4/2 


An incendiary cloud spell exactly resem- 
bles the smoke effects of a pyrotechnics 
spell, except that its minimum dimensions 
are a cloud of 10-foot height by 20-foot 
length and breadth. This dense vapor cloud 
billows forth, and on the third round of its 
existence it begins to flame, causing 1-2 
points of damage per level of the wizard 
who cast it. On the fourth round it inflicts 
1d4 points of damage per level of the caster, 
and on the fifth round this again drops to 
1-2 points of damage per level as its flames 
burn out. Any successive rounds of exist- 
ence are simply harmless smoke that 
obscures vision within its confines. Crea- 
tures within the cloud need to make only 
one saving throw if it is successful, but if 
they fail the first saving throw, they roll 
again on the fourth and fifth rounds (if nec- 
essary) to attempt to reduce damage sus- 
tained by one-half. 

In order to cast this spell, the wizard must 
have an available fire source (just as with a 
pyrotechnics spell), scrapings from beneath 
a dung pile, and a pinch of dust. 


Wizard Spells (8th Level) 


Mass Charm (Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Component: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A mass charm spell affects either persons 
or monsters just as a charm person spell or a 
charm monster spell. The mass charm spell, 
however, affects a number of creatures 
whose combined levels of experience or Hit 
Dice does not exceed twice the level of expe- 
rience of the spellcaster. All affected crea- 
tures must be within the spell range and 
within a 30-foot cube. Note that the crea- 
tures’ saving throws are unaffected by the 
number of recipients (see the charm person 
and charm monster spells), but all target 
creatures are subject to a penalty of —2 on 
their saving throws because of the efficiency 
and power of this spell. The Wisdom bonus 
against charm spells does apply. 


Maze (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


An extradimensional space is brought into 
being upon utterance of a maze spell. The sub- 
ject vanishes into the shifting labyrinth of 
force planes for a period of time that is totally 
dependent upon its Intelligence. (Note: Mino- 


taurs are not affected by this spell.) 
Intelligence of Time Trapped 
Mazed Creature in Maze 
under 3 2d4 turns 
3to5 1d4 turns 
6to8 5d4 rounds 
9toll 4d4 rounds 
12 to 14 3d4 rounds 
15 to 17 2d4 rounds 
18 and up 1d4 rounds 


Note that teleport and dimension door 
spells will not help a character escape a 
maze spell, although a plane shifting spell 
will. 


Mind Blank (Abjuration) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 day 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


When the very powerful mind blank spell 
is cast, the creature is totally protected from 
all devices and spells that detect, influence, 


or read emotions or thoughts. This protects 
against augury, charm, command, confu- 
sion, divination, empathy (all forms), ESP. 
fear, feeblemind, mass suggestion, phantas- 
mal killer, possession, rulership, soul trap- 
ping, suggestion, and telepathy. Cloaking 
protection also extends to the prevention of 
discovery or information gathering by crys- 
tal balls or other scrying devices, clairaudi- 
ence, clairvoyance, communing, contacting 
other planes, or wish-related methods 
(wish, limited wish). Of course, exceedingly 
powerful deities can penetrate the spell’s 
barrier. 


Monster Summoning VI 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 80 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 7 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- 
ster summoning | spell, except that it sum- 
mons 1d3 6th-level monsters. These appear 
in 1d3 rounds within the spell range and at- 
tack the caster’s opponents, until either he 
commands them to cease, the spell duration 
expires, or the monsters are slain. These 
creatures do not check morale, and they 
vanish when slain. If no opponent exists to 
fight, summoned monsters can, if the wiz- 
ard can communicate with them, and if they 
are physically capable, perform other serv- 
ices for the summoning wizard. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) 
candle. 


Otiluke’s Telekinetic Sphere 
(Evocation, Alteration) 


Range: 20 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1-foot-diameter sphere 
per level 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell is exactly the same as the 4th- 
level wizard spell, Otiluke’s resilient sphere, 
with the addition that the creatures or ob- 
jects inside the globe are just about 
weightless—anything contained within it 
weighs only 1/16 of its normal weight. Any 
subject weighing up to 5,000 pounds can be 
telekinetically lifted in the sphere by the 
caster. Range of control extends to a maxi- 
mum distance of 10 yards/level after the 
sphere has actually succeeded in encapsulat- 
ing a subject or subjects. Note that even if 
more than 5,000 pounds of weight is en- 
globed, the perceived weight is but 1/16 of 


190 


actual, so the orb can be rolled without ex- 
ceptional effort. Because of the reduced 
weight, rapid motion or falling within the 
field of the sphere is relatively harmless to 
the object therein, although it can be disas- 
trous should the globe disappear when the 
subject inside is high above a hard surface. 
The caster can dismiss the effect with a 
word. 

In addition to a hemispherical piece of di- 
amond and a matching piece of gum arabic, 
the caster must also have a pair of small bar 
magnets as material components for this 


spell. 


Otto’s Irresistible Dance 
(Enchantment/Charm) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V 

Duration: 1d4 + 1 rounds 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When an Otto's irresistible dance spell is 
placed upon a creature, the spell causes the 
recipient to begin dancing, complete with 
feet shuffling and tapping. This dance 
makes it impossible for the victim to do any- 
thing other than caper and prance; this ca- 
vorting worsens the Armor Class of the 
creature by —4, makes saving throws im- 
possible except on a roll of 20, and negates 
any consideration of a shield. Note that the 
creature must be touched—as if melee com- 
bat were taking place and the spellcaster 
were striking to do damage. 


Permanency (Alteration) 


Range: Special 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 2 rounds 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell affects the duration of certain 
other spells, making the duration perma- 
nent. The personal spells upon which a per- 
manency is known to be effective are as 
follows: 


comprehend 
languages protection from evil 
detect evil protection from 
detect invisibility normal missiles 
detect magic read magic 
infravision tongues 
protection from unseen servant 
cantrips 


The wizard casts the desired spell and 
then follows with the permanency spell. 
Each permanency spell lowers the wizard’s 
Constitution by 1 point. The wizard cannot 
cast these spells upon other creatures. This 


Wizard Spells (8th Level) 


application of permanency can be dispelled 
only by a wizard of greater level than the 
spellcaster was when he cast the spell. 

In addition to personal use, the perma- 
nency spell can be used to make the follow- 
ing object/creature or area-effect spells 
permanent: 


enlarge prismatic sphere 
fear stinking cloud 
gust of wind wall of fire 
invisibility wall of force 
magic mouth web 


Additionally, the following spells can be 
cast upon objects or areas only and ren- 
dered permanent: 


alarm wall of fire 
audible glamer distance distortion 
dancing lights teleport 

solid fog 


These applications to other spells allow it 
to be cast simultaneously with any of the 
latter when no living creature is the target, 
but the entire spell complex then can be dis- 
pelled normally, and thus negated. 

The permanency spell is also used in the 
fabrication of magical items (see the 6th- 
level enchant an item spell). At the DM's 
option, permanency might become unstable 
or fail after a long period, at least 1,000 
years. Unstable effects might operate inter- 
mittently or fail altogether. 

The DM may allow other selected spells 
to be made permanent. Researching this 
possible application of a spell costs as much 
time and money as independently research- 
ing the selected spell. If the DM has already 
determined that the application is not possi- 
ble, the research automatically fails. Note 
that the wizard never learns what is possi- 
ble, except by the success or failure of his 
research, 


Polymorph Any Object (Alteration) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Variable 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell changes one object or creature 
into another. When used as a polymorph 
other or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the 
spell as a more powerful version, with sav- 
ing throws made with —4 penalties to the 
die roll. When it is cast in order to change 
other objects, the duration of the spell will 
depend on how radical a change it is from 
the original state to its enchanted state, as 
well as how different it is in size. This will be 
determined by your Dungeon Master by 
using the following guidelines: 


Kingdom Animal, vegetable, mineral 

Class Mammals, bipeds, fungi, 
metals, etc. 

Relationship Twig is to tree, sand is to 
beach, etc. 

Size Smaller, equal, larger 

Shape Comparative resemblance of 


the original to the poly- 
morphed state 

Particularly with regard to a 
change in which the end 
product is more intelligent 


A change in kingdom makes the spell 
work for hours or turns—i.e., hours if one 
removed, turns if two removed. Other 
changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, 
changing a lion to an androsphinx would be 
permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple 
worm would be a change of only hours 
duration; turning a tusk into an elephant 
would be permanent, but turning a twig 
into a sword would be a change of only sev- 
eral turns duration. All polymorphed 
objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dis- 
pel magic spell is successfully cast upon 
them, they return to their natural form. 
Note that a stone to flesh, or its reverse, will 
affect objects under this spell. As with other 
polymorph spells, damage sustained in the 
new form can result in the injury or death of 
the polymorphed creature. It is possible to 
polymorph a creature into rock and grind it 
to dust, causing damage, perhaps even 
death. If the creature was changed to dust to 
start with, more creative methods to dam- 
age it would have to be applied—perhaps 
using a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust 
far and wide. In general, damage occurs 
when the new form is altered through physi- 
cal force, although the DM will have to 
adjudicate many of these situations. 

The system shock roll must be applied to 
living creatures, as must the restrictions 
noted regarding the polymorph others and 
stone to flesh spells. Also note that a poly- 
morph effect often detracts from an item's 
or creature's powers, but does not add new 
powers—except possibly movement capa- 
bilities not present in the old form. Thus, a 
vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger 
would not retain vorpal capability. Like- 
wise, valueless items cannot be made into 
permanent valuable items. 

The material components of this spell are 


Intelligence 


Power Word, Blind 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 5 yards/level 

Components: V 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: None 


When a power word, blind spell is cast, 
one or more creatures within the area of 
effect become sightless. The spellcaster 
selects one creature as the target center, and 
the effect spreads outward from the center, 
affecting creatures with the lowest hit point 
totals first; alternatively, the spell can be 
focused to affect only an individual crea- 
ture. Creatures with a current hit point total 
over 100 hit points are not affected and do 
not count against the number of creatures 
affected. The spell affects up to 100 hit 
points of creatures, but the duration 
depends upon how many hit points are 
affected. If 25 or fewer hit points are affect- 
ed, the blindness is permanent until cured. If 
26 to 50 hit points are affected, the blindness 
lasts for 1d4 +1 turns, if 51 to 100 hit points 
of creatures are affected, the spell duration 
is but 1d4+1 rounds. An individual crea- 
ture cannot be partially affected; if all of its 
current hit points are affected, it is blinded, 
otherwise, it is not. Blindness can be 
removed by a cure blindness or dispel magic 


spell. 


Prismatic Wall 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell enables the wizard to conjure 
up a vertical, opaque wall—a shimmering, 
multi-colored plane of light that gives him 
protection from all forms of attack. This 
scintillating wall flashes all colors of the vis- 
ible spectrum. Seven of the colors have dis- 
tinct powers and purposes. Any creature 
with fewer than 8 Hit Dice that is within 20 
feet of the wall and that does not shield its 
vision is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the col- 
ors of the wall. The wall is immobile. The 
spellcaster can pass through the wall with- 
out harm, however. Each color in the wall 
has a special effect. Each color can also be 
negated by a specific magical effect, but the 
colors must be negated in the precise order 
of the spectrum. The colors and effects (on a 
being trying to attack the caster) of the pris- 
matic wall spell, as well as what will negate 
each color, are as follows (see next page): 


}t4 


Wizard Spells (8th Level) 


Order Prismatic Wall Effects 
Color of Color _ Effects of Color Spell Negated By 
Red 1st Stops nonmagical missiles—inflicts 20 points of damage, save for half cone of cold 
Orange 2nd Stops magical missiles—inflicts 40 points of damage, save for half gust of wind 
Yellow 3rd Stops poisons, gases, and petrification—inflicts 80 points of damage, save for half disintegrate 
Green 4th Stops breath weapons—save vs. poison or die, survivors suffer 20 points of damage passwall 
Blue Sth Stops location/detection and mental attacks—save vs. petrification or turned to stone magic missile 
Indigo 6th Stops magical spells—save vs. wand or insane continual light 
Violet 7th Force field protection—save vs. spell or sent to another plane dispel magic 


The wall's maximum proportions are 40 
feet wide per level of experience of the caster 
and 20 feet high per level of experience. A 
prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a 
space occupied by a creature is disrupted 
and the spell is wasted. 


Screen (Divination/IIlusion) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 hour/level 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell combines several elements to 
create a powerful protection from scrying 
and direct observation. When the spell is 
cast, the wizard dictates what will and will 
not be observed in the area of effect. The il- 
lusion created must be stated in general 
terms. Thus the caster could specify the illu- 
sion of him and another playing chess for 
the duration of the spell, but he could not 
have the illusionary chess players take a 
break, make dinner, and then resume their 
game. He could have a crossroads appear 
quiet and empty even while an army is actu- 
ally passing through the area. He could 
specify that no one be seen (including pass- 
ing strangers), that his troops be unde- 
tected, or even that every fifth man or unit 
should be visible. Once the conditions are 
set, they cannot be changed. 

Attempts to scry the area automatically 
detect the image stated by the caster with no 
saving throw allowed. Sight and sound are 
appropriate to the illusion created. A band 
of men standing in a meadow could be con- 
cealed as an empty meadow with birds 
chirping, etc. Direct observation may allow 
a saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if 
there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Cer- 
tainly onlookers in the area would become 
suspicious if the column of a marching army 
disappeared at one point to reappear at an- 
other! Even entering the area does not can- 
cel the illusion or necessarily allow a saving 
throw, assuming care is taken by the hidden 
beings to stay out of the way of those af- 
fected by the illusion. 


Serten’s Spell Immunity (Abjuration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 1 round/recipient 
Area of Effect: Creature(s) touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By use of this spell, the wizard is able to 
confer virtual immunity to certain spells 
and magical attack forms upon those he 
touches. For every four levels of experience 
of the wizard, one creature can be pro- 
tected by the Serten’s spell immunity spell, 
but, if more than one is protected, the du- 
ration of the protection is divided among 
the protected creatures. (Example: A 16th- 
level wizard can cast the spell upon one 
creature and it will last 16 turns, or place it 
upon two creatures for eight turns, or upon 
four creatures for four turns.) The protec- 
tion gives a bonus to saving throws, ac- 
cording to spell type and level, as shown in 
the following table. 


Spell level Wizard Spell Priest Spell 
1st-3rd +9" nd i 
4th-6th +7 +5 
7th-8th +5 +3 


* Includes beguiling effects. 


The material component of this spell is a 
diamond of at least 500 gp value, which 
must be crushed and sprinkled over the spell 
recipients. Each such creature must also 
have in its possession a diamond of at least 
one carat size, intact and carried on its per- 
son. 


Sink (Enchantment, Alteration) 


Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: 1 creature or 1 object of 1 cu- 
bic foot/level 

Saving Throw: Special 


By means of this spell, a wizard can force 
a creature or object into the very earth or 
floor upon which it stands. When casting 
the spell, the wizard must chant the spell for 
the remainder of the round without inter- 
ruption. At that juncture, the subject crea- 
ture or object becomes rooted to the spot 


192 


unless a saving throw vs. spell (for a crea- 
ture) or a saving throw vs. disintegration 
(for an object with magical properties) is 
successful. (Note: “magical properties” in- 
clude those of magical items as listed in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide, those of items en- 
chanted or otherwise of magical origin, and 
those of items with protection-type spells or 
with permanent magical properties or simi- 
lar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical 
nature are not entitled to a saving throw. 
The subject becomes of slightly greater den- 
sity than the surface upon which it stands if 
its saving throw was not successful. 

The spellcaster now has the option of 
ceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it 
is, in which case the spell expires in four 
turns, and the subject returns to normal. If 
the caster proceeds with the spell (into the 
next round), the subject begins to sink 
slowly into the ground. Before any actions 
are taken in the new round, the subject sinks 
one-quarter of its height; after the first 
group acts, another one-quarter; after the 
second group acts, another; at the end of the 
round, the victim is totally sunken into the 
ground. 

This entombment places a creature or ob- 
ject into a state of suspended animation. 
The cessation of time means that the subject 
does not grow older. Bodily and other func- 
tions virtually cease, but the subject is oth- 
erwise unharmed. The subject exists in 
undamaged form in the surface into which it 
was sunk, its upper point as far beneath the 
surface as the subject has height—a six-foot- 
tall victim will be six feet beneath the sur- 
face, while a 60-foot-tall subject will have 
its uppermost point 60 feet below ground 
level. If the ground around the subject is 
somehow removed, the spell is broken and 
the subject returns to normal, but it does not 
rise up. Such spells as dig, transmute rock to 
mud, and freedom (reverse of the 9th-level 
imprisonment spell) will not harm the 
sunken creature or object and will often be 
helpful in recovering it. If a detect magic 
spell is cast over an area upon which a sink 
spell was used, it reveals a faint magical 
aura of undefinable nature, even if the sub- 
ject is beyond detection range. If the subject 
is within range of the detection, the spells 
schools can be discovered (alteration and 
enchantment). 


Wizard Spells (8th Level) 


Symbol (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: Special 

A symbol spell creates magical runes 

affecting creatures that pass over, touch, or 
read the runes, or pass through a portal 
upon which the symbol is inscribed. Upon 
casting the spell, the wizard inscribes the 
symbol upon whatever surface he desires. 
Likewise, the spellcaster is able to place the 
symbol of his choice, using any one of the 
following: 
Death One or more creatures, 
whose total hit points do 
not exceed 80, are slain. 
All creatures are affected 
and immediately fall to loud 
bickering and arguing; there 
is a 50% probability that 
creatures of different align- 
ments attack each other. 
The bickering lasts for 5d4 
rounds, the fighting for 2d4 
rounds. 
Fear This symbol creates an 
extra-strong fear spell, caus- 
ing all creatures to save vs. 
spell with —4 penalties to 
the die roll, or panic and flee 
as if attacked by a fear spell. 
All creatures are affected 
and must turn back in dejec- 
tion unless they save vs. 
spell. Affected creatures 
submit to the demands of 
any opponent—e.g., sur- 
render, get out, etc.; the 
hopelessness lasts for 3d4 
turns. During this period it 
is 25% probable that affect- 
ed creatures take no action 
during any round, and 25% 
likely that those taking 
action turn back or retire 
from battle, as applicable. 
One or more creatures 
whose total hit points do 
not exceed 120 become 
insane and remain so, acting 
as if a confusion spell had 
been placed upon them, 
until a heal, restoration, or 
wish spell is used to remove 
the madness. 

Pain All creatures are afflicted 
with wracking pains shoot- 
ing through their bodies, 
causing a —2 penalty to 
Dexterity and a —4 penalty 
to attack dice for 2d10 
turns. 


Discord 


Hopelessness 


Insanity 


All creatures under 8 +1 Hit 
Dice immediately fall into a 
catatonic slumber and can- 
not be awakened for 1d12 
+ 4 turns. 

One or more creatures 
whose total hit points do 
not exceed 160 are stunned 
and reeling for 3d4 rounds, 
dropping anything they are 
holding. 

The type of symbol cannot be recognized 
without being read and thus activating its 
effects. 

The material components of this spell are 
powdered black opal and diamond dust, 
worth not less than 5,000 gp each. 


Sleep 


Stunning 


Trap the Soul (Conjuratiow/Summoning) 


Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent until broken 
Casting Time: Special + 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 

Saving Throw: Special 

This spell forces the creature's life force 
(and its material body) into a special prison 
gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The crea- 
ture must be seen by the caster when the 
final word is uttered. 

The spell can be triggered in one of two 
ways. First, the final word of the spell can be 
spoken when the creature is within spell 
range. This allows magic resistance (if any) 
and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the 
effect. If the creature's real name is spoken 
as well, any magic resistance is ignored and 
the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty 
of —2., If the saving throw is successful, the 
prison gem shatters. 

The second method is far more insidious, 
for it tricks the victim into accepting a trig- 
ger object inscribed with the final spell 
word, automatically placing the creature's 
soul into the trap. To use this method, both 
the creature's true name and the trigger 
word must be inscribed on the trigger item 
when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy 
spell can also be placed on the trigger item. 
As soon as the subject creature picks up or 
accepts the trigger item, its life force is auto- 
matically transferred to the gem, without 
the benefit of magic resistance or saving 
throw. 

The gem prison will hold the trapped enti- 
ty indefinitely, or until the gem is broken 
and the life force is released, allowing the 
material body to reform. If the creature 
trapped is a powerful creature from another 
plane (and this could actually mean a char- 
acter trapped by some inhabitant of another 
plane of existence when the character is not 
on the Prime Material plane), it can be 
required to perform a service immediately 
upon being freed. Otherwise the creature 


193 


can go free once the gem imprisoning it is 
broken. 

Before the actual casting of the trap the 
soul spell, the wizard must prepare the 
prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for 
every Hit Die or level of experience pos- 
sessed by the creature to be trapped (e.g., it 
requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 
10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem 
is not valuable enough, it shatters when the 
entrapment is attempted. (Note that while 
characters have no concept of level as such, 
the value of the gem needed to trap an indi- 
vidual can be researched. Remember that 
this value can change over time as charac- 
ters advance.) Creating the prison gem 
requires an enchant an item spell and the 
placement of a maze spell into the gem, 
thereby forming the prison to contain the 
life force, 


Wizard Spells (9th Level) 


Ninth-Level Spells 


Astral Spell (Evocation) 
Range: Touch 


Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of the astral spell, a wizard can 
project his astral body into the Astral plane, 
leaving his physical body and material pos- 
sessions behind in the Prime Material plane 
(the plane in which the entire universe and 
all of its parallels exist). Only magical items 
can be brought into the Astral plane 
(although nonmagical items could be ren- 
dered temporarily magical through the use 
of some spells, if the DM allows). As the 
Astral plane touches upon all of the first 
levels of the outer planes, the wizard can 
travel astrally to any of these outer planes as 
he wills. The caster then leaves the Astral 
plane, forming a body in the plane of exist- 
ence he has chosen to enter. It is also possi- 
ble to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime 
Material plane by means of the astral spell, 
but a second body cannot be formed in the 
Prime Material plane. As a general rule, a 
person astrally projected can be seen only 
by creatures in the Astral plane. 

At all times, the astral body is connected 
to the material body by a silvery cord. If the 
cord is broken, the affected person is killed, 
astrally and materially, but normally only 
the psychic wind can cause the cord to 
break. When a second body is formed in a 
different plane, the silvery cord remains 
invisibly attached to the new body. If the 
astral form is slain, the cord simply returns 
to the original body where it rests in the 
Prime Material plane, reviving it from its 
state of suspended animation. 

Although astrally projected persons are 
able to function in the Astral plane, their 
actions do not affect creatures not existing 
in the Astral plane. The spell lasts until the 
wizard desires to end it, or until it is termi- 
nated by some outside means (a dispel mag- 
ic spell or destruction of the wizard’s body 
in the Prime Material plane). 

The wizard can project the astral forms of 
up to seven other creatures with him by 
means of the astral spell, providing the crea- 
tures are linked in a circle with the wizard. 
These fellow travelers are dependent upon 
the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in 
the Astral plane can be slow or fast accord- 
ing to the wizard’s desire. The ultimate des- 
tination arrived at is subject to the 
conceptualization of the mage. (See the 
Manual of the Planes for further informa- 
tion on the Astral plane and astral projec- 
tion.) 

Any magical items can go into the Astral 


plane, but most become temporarily non- 
magical therein, or in any planes removed 
from the Prime Material plane. Armor and 
weapons of +3 or better might function in 
other planes at the DM's option. Artifacts 
and relics function anywhere. Items draw- 
ing their power from a given plane are more 
powerful in that plane (e.g., a ring of fire 
resistance in the elemental plane of Fire or a 
sword of life stealing in the Negative Mate- 
rial plane). 


Bigby’s Crushing Hand (Evocation) 


Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The Bigby’s crushing hand spell creates a 
huge, disembodied hand similar to those of 
the other Bigby's hand spells. The crushing 
hand is under the mental control of the cast- 
er, and he can cause it to grasp and squeeze 
an opponent. No attack roll is necessary; 
the hand automatically grasps and inflicts 
constriction damage any round in which the 
wizard concentrates. The damage inflicted 
depends on the number of rounds it acts 
upon the victim: 


Ist round 1d10 hit points 
2nd and 3rd rounds 2d10 hit points 
4th & beyond 4d10 hit points 


The crushing hand has an Armor Class of 
0, has as many hit points as its caster at full 
strength, and vanishes when destroyed. The 
hand is susceptible to normal combat 
attacks and damaging spells, but if it is 
struck by an area-effect spell, the person 
held suffers the same fate as the hand (i.e., if 
the hand fails its saving throw, the victim 
automatically fails his). The hand is not 
effective against noncorporeal or gaseous 
forms, but it does prevent creatures that are 
able to slip through small cracks from 
escaping. If the hand grasps an item or con- 
struction, the appropriate saving throw 
must be made as if squeezed by a Strength of 
25. 

The material components of the spell are 
a glove of snake skin and the shell of an egg. 


Crystalbrittle (Alteration) 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: 2 cubic ft./level 
Saving Throw: Special 


The magic of this spell causes metal, 
whether as soft as gold or as hard as ada- 
mantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as 
brittle and fragile as crystal. Thus a sword, 


194 


metal shield, metal armor, or even an iron 
golem can be changed to a delicate, glass- 
like material easily shattered by any forceful 
blow. Furthermore, this change is unalter- 
able short of a wish spell; a dispel magic will 
not reverse the spell. 

The caster must physically touch the 
item—if it is an opponent or something an 
opponent is using or wearing, the wizard 
must get into melee and roll a successful 
attack roll. Any single metal item can be 
affected by the spell. Thus a suit of armor 
worn by a creature can be changed to crys- 
tal, but the creature's shield would not be 
affected, or vice versa. All items gain a sav- 
ing throw equal to their magical bonus val- 
ue or protection (the DM has this 
information). A +1/ +3 sword would get a 
10% (average of the two pluses) chance to 
save; +5 magical armor has a 25% chance 
to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% 
chance to save (for it is hit only by magical 
weapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts 
and relics constructed of metal may be 
affected at the discretion of the DM (this is 
highly unlikely). Affected items not imme- 
diately protected are shattered and perma- 
nently destroyed if struck by a normal blow 
from a metal tool or any weighty weapon, 
including a staff. 


Energy Drain (Evocation, Necromancy) 


Range: Touch ‘ 
Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 

Saving Throw: None 


By casting this spell, the wizard opens a 
channel between the plane he is in and the 
Negative Material plane, the caster becom- 
ing the conductor between the two planes. 
As soon as he touches (equal to a hit if melee 
is involved) any living creature, the victim 
loses two levels (as if struck by a spectre). A 
monster loses 2 Hit Dice permanently, both 
for hit points and attack ability. A character 
loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abili- 
ties permanently (until regained through 
adventuring, if applicable). 

The material component of this spell is 
essence of spectre or vampire dust. Prepara- 
tion requires mere moments, then the mate- 
rial component is cast forth, and upon 
touching the victim, the wizard speaks the 
triggering word, causing the spell to take 
effect instantly. 

The spell remains effective for a single 
round only. Humans or humanoids brought 
below zero energy levels by this spell can be 
animated as juju zombies under the control 
of the caster. 

The caster always has a 5% (1 in 20) 
chance to be affected by the dust, losing one 
point of Constitution at the same time as the 


Wizard Spells (9th Level) 


victim is drained. When the number of Con-

Foresight (Divination) 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration; 2d4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell grants the caster a powerful 
sixth sense in relation to himself or another. 
Although cast upon himself, the wizard can 
specify that he or another is the beneficiary 
of the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard 
receives instantaneous warnings of impend- 
ing danger or harm to the object of the spell. 
Thus, if he were the object of the spell, the 
wizard would be warned in advance if a 
thief were about to attempt to backstab 
him, or if a creature were about to leap out 
from an unexpected direction, or if an 
attacker were specifically targeting him 
with a spell or missile weapon. When the 
warnings are about him personally, the wiz- 
ard cannot be surprised and always knows 
the direction from which any attack on him 
is made. In addition, the spell gives the wiz- 
ard a general idea of what action he might 
take to best protect himself— duck, jump 
right, close his eyes, etc.—and gives him a 
defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class. 
When another is the object of the spell, the 
wizard receives warnings about that person. 
He must still communicate this to the other 
to negate any surprise. Shouting a warning, 
yanking the person back, even telepathical- 
ly communicating through a crystal ball can 
all be accomplished before the trap is 
sprung—if the wizard does not hesitate. The 
object of the spell does not gain the defen- 
sive bonus to his Armor Class, however. 

The material component for this spell is a 
hummingbird’s feather. 


Gate (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Range: 30 yards 


Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The casting of a gate spell has two effects. 
First, it causes an interdimensional connec- 
tion between the plane of existence the wiz- 
ard is in and the plane in which dwells a 
specific being of great power, enabling the 
being to merely step through the gate, or 
portal, from its plane to that of the caster. 
Second, the utterance of the spell attracts 
the attention of the sought-after dweller in 
the other plane. When casting the spell, the 


wizard must name the entity he desires to 
use the gate and to come to the wizard’s aid. 
There is a 100% certainty that something 
steps through the gate. Unless the DM has 
some facts prepared regarding the minions 
serving the being called forth by the gate 
spell, the being itself comes. 

If the matter is trifling, the being might 
leave, inflict an appropriate penalty on the 
wizard, or attack the wizard; if the matter is 
of middling importance, the being can take 
some positive action to set matters aright, 
then demand appropriate repayment; and if 
the matter is urgent, it can act accordingly 
and ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if 
appropriate. The actions of the being that 
comes through depend on many factors, 
including the alignments of the wizard and 
the deity, the nature of his companions, and 
who or what opposes or threatens the wiz- 
ard. Such beings generally avoid direct con- 
flict with their equals or betters. The being 
gated in will either return immediately (very 
unlikely) or remain to take action, Casting 
this spell ages the wizard five years. 


Imprisonment (Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


When an imprisonment spell is cast and 
the victim is touched, the recipient is 
entombed in a state of suspended animation 
(see the temporal stasis spell) in a small 
sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. 
The victim remains there unless a reverse of 
the spell, with the creature's name and back- 
ground, is cast. Magical search by crystal 
ball, a locate object spell, or similar means 
will not reveal the fact that a creature is 
imprisoned. The imprisonment spell func- 
tions only if the subject creature’s name and 
background are known. 

The reverse spell, freedom, cast upon the 
spot at which a creature was entombed and 
sunk into the earth, causes it to reappear at 
that spot. If the caster does not perfectly 
intone the name and background of the 
creature to be freed, there is a 10% chance 
that 1 to 100 creatures will be freed from 
imprisonment at the same time. 

Note: The exact details of any creatures 
freed are up to the DM. A random method 
of determining this is to roll percentile dice 
twice (once for imprisoned creature density 
and once for a base number of creatures at 
maximum density). The rolls are multiplied 
and rounded to the nearest whole number. 
Each released creature has a 10% chance to 
be in the area of the spellcaster. If monsters 
are being generated randomly, roll 1d20 for 


195 


level, with rolls of 9+ considered 9, and the 
exact monsters determined by the random 
encounter tables. 

For example, if the initial rolls were 22 
and 60, the number of monsters released is 
.22 X .60 = .1320 = 13 monsters. Since 
only 10% of these will be in the immediate 
vicinity of the caster, the wizard may 
encounter only one or two of them. 


Meteor Swarm (Evocation) 


Range: 40 yards + 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Instantaneous 

Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: '/2 


A meteor swarm is a very powerful and 
spectacular spell which is similar to the fire- 
ball spell in many aspects. When it is cast, 
either four spheres of two-foot diameter or 
eight spheres of one-foot diameter spring 
from the outstretched hand of the wizard 
and streak in a straight line to the distance 
demanded by the spellcaster, up to the maxi- 
mum range. Any creature in the straight- 
line path of these missiles receives the full 
effect of the missile, or missiles, without 
benefit of a saving throw. The meteor mis- 
siles leave a fiery trail of sparks, and each 
bursts as a fireball. The large spheres inflict 
10d4 points of damage, bursting in a dia- 
mond or box pattern. Each has a 30-foot 
diameter area of effect, and each sphere is 20 
feet apart, along the sides of the pattern, so 
that there are overlapping areas of effect, 
and the center will be exposed to all four 
blasts. The eight spheres have one-half the 
diameter (15 feet) and one-half the damage 
potential (Sd4). They burst in a pattern of a 
box within a diamond or vice versa, each of 
the outer sides 20 feet long. Note that the 
center has four areas of overlapping effect, 
and there are numerous peripheral areas 
that have two overlapping areas of effect. A 
saving throw for each area of effect will 
indicate whether full damage or half dam- 
age is sustained by creatures within each 
area, except as already stated with regard to 
the missiles impacting. 


Monster Summoning VII 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 90 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 8 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- 
ster summoning | spell, except that this spell 
summons one or two 7th-level monsters 
that appear one round after the spell is cast, 


Wizard Spells (9th Level) 


or one 8th-level monster that appears two 
rounds after the spell is cast. 


Mordenkainen’s Disjunction 
(Alteration, Enchantment) 


Range: 0 

Components: V 

Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Special 


Wher this spell is cast, all magic and magi- 
cal items within the radius of the spell, except 
those on the person of or being touched by 
the spellcaster, are disjoined. That is, spells 
being cast are separated into their individual 
components (usually spoiling the effect as a 
dispel magic spell does), and permanent and 
enchanted items must save (vs. spell if actu- 
ally cast on a creature, or vs. a dispel magic 
spell otherwise) or be turned into normal 
items. Even artifacts and relics are subject to 
Mordenkainen’s disjunction, although there 
is only a 1% chance per caster experience 
level of actually affecting such powerful 
items. Thus all potions, scrolls, rings, rods, 
miscellaneous magical items, artifacts and 
relics, arms and armor, swords, and miscella- 
neous weapons within 30 feet of the spellcast- 
er can possibly lose all their magical 
properties when the Mordenkainen's disjunc- 
tion spell is cast. The caster also has a 1% 
chance per level of destroying an anti-magic 
shell. If the shell survives the disjunction, no 
items within it are disjoined. 

Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous 
business, and 95% likely to attract the 
attention of some powerful being who has 
an interest or connection with the device. 
Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, the 
casting wizard must roll a successful saving 
throw vs. spell with a —4 penalty or perma- 
nently lose all spellcasting abilities. 


Power Word, Kill 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 5 yards/two levels 
Components: V 

Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


When a power word, kill spell is uttered, 
one or more creatures of any type within the 
spell range and area of effect are slain. The 
power word slays one creature with up to 60 
hit points, or it kills two or more creatures 
with 10 or fewer hit points, up to a maxi- 
mum of 120 hit points. The option to attack 
a single creature, or multiple creatures, 
must be stated along with the spell range 
and area of effect center. The current hit 
points of the creatures are used. 


Prismatic Sphere 
(Abjuration, Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: 0 

Components: V 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell enables the wizard to conjure 
up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmer- 
ing, multi-colored light to surround him, 
giving protection from all forms of attack. 
This scintillating sphere flashes in all colors 
of the visible spectrum. Seven of the colors 
have distinct powers and purposes. Any 
creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blind. 
ed for 2d4 turns by the colors of the sphere. 
Only the spellcaster can pass in and out of 
the prismatic sphere without harm, 
although he can cast it over others to protect 
them. The sphere can be destroyed, color by 
color, in consecutive order, by various mag- 


Color of Order 


ical effects; however, the first must be 
brought down before the second can be 
affected, etc. Any creature passing through 
the barrier receives the effect of every color 
still remaining. Note that typically the 
upper hemisphere of the globe is visible, as 
the spellcaster is at the center of the sphere, 
so the lower half is usually hidden by the 
floor surface he is standing upon. The colors 
and effects of the prismatic sphere, as well 
as what will negate each globe, are shown 
on the accompanying table. 

Note that a rod of cancellation or a Mor- 
denkainen's disjunction spell will destroy a 
prismatic sphere (but an anti-magic shell 
will fail to penetrate it). Otherwise, any- 
thing short of an artifact or relic entering the 
sphere is destroyed, and any creature is sub- 
ject to the effects of every color still active— 
i.e., 70-140 points of damage plus death, 
petrification, insanity, and instantaneous 
transportation to another plane.

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


With this spell, a wizard is able to assume 
the form of any living thing or creature 
below demigod status (greater or lesser dei- 
ty, singular dragon type, or the like). The 
spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, 
and has all of the abilities save those depen- 
dent upon Intelligence, innate magical abili- 
ties, and magic resistance, for the mind of 
the creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus 
he can change into a griffon and fly away, 
then to an efreet and fly through a roaring 
flame, and then to a titan to lift up a wagon, 
etc. These creatures have whatever hit 
points the wizard has at the time of the 
shape change. Each alteration in form 
requires but a second. No system shock is 


196 


* this form is no longer useful, the wizard 


changes into a stone golem and walks away. 
When pursued, the golem-shape is changed 
to that of a flea, which hides upon a horse 
until it can hop off and become a bush. If 
detected as the latter, the wizard can become 
a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he 
is familiar with. 

A wizard adopting another form also 
adops its vulnerabilities. For example, a 
wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless 
in daylight, and is subject to being turned, 
controlled, or destroyed by opposing cler- 
ics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is 
killed in another form does not revert to his 
original shape, which may disallow certain 
types of revivification. 

The material component is a jade circlet 
worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters 
at the end of the spell’s duration. In the 
meantime, the circlet is left in the wake of 


Wizard Spells (9th Level) 


the shape change, and premature shattering 
ends the spell immediately. 


Succor (Alteration, Enchantment) 
Reversible 


Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 to 4 days 
Area of Effect: 1 individual 
Saving Throw: None 


By casting this spell, the wizard creates a 
powerful magic in some specially prepared 
object—a statuette, a jeweled rod, a gem, 
etc. This object radiates magic, for it con- 
tains the power to instantaneously trans- 
port its possessor to the abode of the wizard 
who created it. Once the item is enchanted, 
the wizard must give it willingly to an indi- 
vidual, at the same time informing him of a 
command word to be spoken when the item 
is to be used. To make use of the item, the 
recipient must speak the command word at 
the same time that he rends or breaks the 
item. When this is done, the individual and 
all that he is wearing and carrying are 
instantly transported to the abode of the 
wizard. No other creatures can be affected. 

The reversed application of the spell 
transports the wizard to the immediate 
vicinity of the possessor of the spelled item, 
when it is broken and the command word 
said. The wizard will have a general idea of 
the location and situation of the item pos- 
sessor, but has no choice whether or not to 
go (making this a rare casting indeed!). 

The material components used include 
gemstones totaling not less than 5,000 gp 
value; whether it is a faceted gem or not is 
immaterial. The components can be 
enchanted only once per month (usually on 
a night of a clear, full moon). At that 
time,the object is set for the type of succor 
and its final destination (either the location 
of the spellcasting or an area well known to 
the wizard). 


Temporal! Stasis (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: One creature 
Saving Throw: None 


Upon casting this spell, the wizard places 
the recipient creature into a state of sus- 
pended animation. This cessation of time 
means that the creature does not grow older. 
Its body functions virtually cease. This state 
persists until the magic is removed by a dis- 
pel magic spell or the reverse of the spell 
(temporal reinstatement) is uttered. Note 


that the reverse requires only a single word 
and no somatic or material components. 
The material component of a temporal 
stasis spell is a powder composed of dia- 
mond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust, 
each crushed stone of at least 100 gp value. 


Time Stop (Alteration) 


Range: 0 

Components: V 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: None 


Upon casting a time stop spell, the wizard 
causes the flow of time to stop for one round 
in the area of effect. Outside this area the 
sphere simply seems to shimmer for an 
instant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free 
to act for 1d3 rounds of apparent time. The 
wizard can move and act freely within the 
area where time is stopped, but all other 
creatures, except for those of demigod and 
greater status or unique creatures, are fro- 
zen in their actions, for they are literally 
between ticks of the time clock. (The spell 
duration is subjective to the caster.) Nothing 
can enter the area of effect without being 
stopped in time also. If the wizard leaves the 
area, the spell is immediately negated. 
When the spell duration ceases, the wizard 
is again operating in normal time. 

Note: It is recommended that the DM use 
a stop watch or silently count to time this 
spell. If the caster is unable to complete the 
intended action before the spell duration 
expires, he will probably be caught in an 
embarrassing situation. The use of a fele- 
port spell before the expiration of the time 
stop spell is permissible. 


Weird (Illusion/Phantasm) 


Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: 20-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell confronts those affected by it 
with phantasmal images of their most feared 
enemies, forcing an imaginary combat that 
seems real, but actually occurs in the blink 
of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard 
must be able to converse with the victims to 
bring the spell into being. During the cast- 
ing, the wizard must call out to the creatures 
to be affected, informing one or all that their 
final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon 
them, 

The force of the magic is such that even if 
the creatures make their saving throws vs. 
spell, fear will paralyze them for a full 
round, and they will lose 1d4 Strength 
points from this fear (the lost Strength will 


197 


return in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell 
causes the creature or creatures to face their 
nemeses, the opponents most feared and 
inimical to them. Actual combat must then 
take place, for no magical means of escape is 
possible. The foe fought is real for all intents 
and purposes. Affected creatures that lose, 
die. If a creature's phantasmal nemesis from 
the weird spell is slain, then the creature 
emerges with no damage, no loss of items 
seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of 
spells likewise seemingly expended. Experi- 
ence for defeating the weird is gained if 
applicable. Although each round of combat 
seems normal, it takes but 4/10 of a round, 
During the course of the spell, the caster 
must concentrate fully upon maintaining it. 
If the combat goes beyond ten rounds, those 
who saved against the spell can take action. 
If the caster is disturbed, the weird spell 
ends immediately. Creatures attacked while 
paralyzed with fear are free of the paralysis 
immediately. 


Wish (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Range: Unlimited 
Components: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


The wish spell is a more potent version of 
a limited wish. If it is used to alter reality 
with respect to damage sustained by a party, 
to bring a dead creature to life, or to escape 
from a difficult situation by lifting the spell- 
caster (and his party) from one place to 
another, it will not cause the wizard any dis- 
ability. Other forms of wishes, however, 
cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on 
Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest 
due to the stresses the wish places upon 
time, space, and his body. Regardless of 
what is wished for, the exact terminology of 
the wish spell is likely to be carried out. 
Casting a wish spell ages the caster five 
years. 

This discretionary power of the DM is 
necessary in order to maintain game bal- 
ance. As wishing another creature dead 
would be grossly unfair, for example, your 
DM might well advance the spellcaster to a 
future period in which the creature is no 
longer alive, effectively putting the wishing 
character out of the campaign.

Appendix 4: Priest Spells 


Priest Spells Note 


Following the name 
of each priest spell, notice that a magical 
school is given in parentheses. This is for 
reference purposes only. For instance, Wis- 
dom bonuses apply to saving throws vs. 
enchantment/charm spells. If the appropri- 
ate magical school were not listed with 
priest spells, it would be hard to figure out 
which spells were considered to be 
enchantment/charms. There are a few other 
reasons one might need to know this infor- 
mation. The priest spells are not really orga- 
nized into magical schools, but rather into 
spheres of influence, as described on page 34 
and in Chapter 7: Magic. 

See Appendix 2 on page 129 for explana- 
tions of what the spell parameters (Range, 
Components, etc.) mean.

First-Level Spells 


Animal Friendship 
(Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Area of Effect: 1 animal 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell, the caster is able to 
show any animal of animal intelligence to 
semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that 
he desires friendship. If the animal does not 
roll a successful saving throw vs. spell im- 
mediately when the spell is begun, it stands 
quietly while the caster finishes the spell. 
Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The 
spell functions only if the caster actually 
wishes to be the animal's friend, If the caster 
has ulterior motives, the animal always 
senses them (e.g., the caster intends to eat 
the animal, send it ahead to set off traps, 
etc.). 

The caster can teach the befriended ani- 
mal three specific tricks or tasks for each 
point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical 
tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet 
(i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for 
each such trick must be done over a period 
of one week, and all must be done within 
three months of acquiring the creature. Dur- 
ing the three-month period, the animal will 
not harm the caster, but if the creature is left 
alone for more than a week, it will revert to 
its natural state and act accordingly. 

The caster can use this spell to attract up 
to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience 
level he possesses. This is also the maximum 
total Hit Dice of the animals that can be at- 
tracted and trained at one time: no more 
than twice the caster’s experience level. 
Only unaligned animals can be attracted, 
befriended, and trained. 

The material components of this spell are 
the caster’s holy symbol and a piece of food 
the animal likes. 


Bless (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Reversible 


Sphere: All 

Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 6 rounds 

Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 50-foot cube 
Saving Throw: None 


Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster 
raises the morale of friendly creatures and 
any saving throw rolls they make against 
fear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises 
their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing, 


however, affects only those not already en- 
gaged in melee combat. The caster deter- 
mines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will 
cast the spell. At the instant the spell is com- 
pleted, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot 
cube centered on the point selected by the 
caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the 
area are still subject to the spell’s effect; 
those entering the area after the casting is 
completed are not). 

A second use of this spell is to bless a sin- 
gle item (for example, a crossbow bolt for 
use against a rakshasa). The weight of the 
item is limited to one pound per caster level 
and the effect lasts until the item is used or 
the spell duration ends. 

Multiple bless spells are not cumulative. 
In addition to the verbal and somatic ges- 
ture components, the bless spell requires 
holy water. 

This spell can be reversed by the priest to 
a curse spell upon enemy creatures that 
lowers their morale and attack rolls by —1. 
The curse requires the sprinkling of unholy 
water. 


Combine (Evocation) 


Sphere: All 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: The circle of priests 
Saving Throw: None 


Using this spell, three to five priests com- 
bine their abilities so that one of them casts 
spells and turns undead at an enhanced 
level. The highest level priest (or one of 
them, if two or more are tied for highest) 
stands alone, while the others join hands in 
a surrounding circle. The central priest casts 
the combine spell. He temporarily gains one 
level for each priest in the circle, up to a 
maximum gain of four levels. The level in- 
crease affects turning undead and spell de- 
tails that vary with the caster’s level. Note 
that the central priest gains no additional 
spells and that the group is limited to his 
currently memorized spells. 

The encircling priests must concentrate 
on maintaining the combine effect. 
lose all Armor Class bonuses for shield and 
Dexterity. If any of them has his concentra- 
tion broken, the combine spell ends immedi- 
ately. If the combine spell is broken while 
the central priest is in the act of casting a 
spell, that spell is ruined just as if the caster 
was disturbed. Spells cast in combination 
have the full enhanced effect, even if the 
combine is broken before the duration of 
the enhanced spell ends. Note that the com- 
bination is not broken if only the central 
caster is disturbed. 


Command (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Charm 

Range: 30 yards 
Component: V 
Duration: 1 round 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the priest to command 
another creature with a single word. The 
command must be uttered in a language un- 
derstood by the creature. The subject will 
obey to the best of his/its ability only as 
long as the command is absolutely clear and 
unequivocal; hence, a command of “Sui- 
cide!” is ignored. A command to “Die!” 
causes the creature to fall in a faint or cata- 
leptic state for one round, but thereafter the 
creature revives and is alive and well. Typi- 
cal commands are back, halt, flee, run, 
stop, fall, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, 
etc. No command affects a creature for 
more than one round; undead are not af- 
fected at all. Creatures with Intelligence of 
13 (high) or more, or those with 6 or more 
Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to 
a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted for Wis- 
dom. (Creatures with 13 or higher Intelli- 
gence and 6 Hit Dice/levels get only one 
saving throw!) 


Create Water (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Water) 

Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Up to 27 cubic feet 
Saving Throw: None 


When the priest casts a create water spell, 
up to four gallons of water are generated for 
every experience level of the caster (e.g., a 
2nd-level priest creates up to eight gallons of 
water, a 3rd-level up to 12 gallons, etc.). 
The water is clean and drinkable (it is just 
like rain water). The created water can be 
dispelled within a round of its creation, oth- 
erwise its magic fades, leaving normal water 
that can be used, spilled, evaporated, etc. 
Reversing the spell, destroy water, obliter- 
ates without trace (no vapor, mist, fog, or 
steam) a like quantity of water. Water can 
be created or destroyed in an area as small 
as will actually contain the liquid, or in an 
area as large as 27 cubic feet (1 cubic yard). 

The spell requires at least a drop of water 
to create, or a pinch of dust to destroy, water. 

Note that water can neither be created 
nor destroyed within a creature. For refer- 
ence purposes, water weighs about 8 */2 
pounds per gallon, and a cubic foot of water 
weighs approximately 64 pounds. 


Cure Light Wounds (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Healing 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When casting this spell and laying his 
hand upon a creature, the priest causes 1d8 
points of wound or other injury damage to 
the creature's body to be healed. This heal- 
ing cannot affect creatures without corpo- 
real bodies, nor can it cure wounds of 
creatures not living or of extraplanar origin. 

The reversed spell, cause light wounds, 
operates in the same manner, inflicting 1d8 
points of damage. If a creature is avoiding 
this touch, an attack roll is needed to deter- 
mine if the priest's hand strikes the oppo- 
nent and causes such a wound. 

Curing is permanent only insofar as the 
creature does not sustain further damage; 
caused wounds will heal—or can be cured— 
just as any normal injury. 


Detect Evil (Divination) 
Reversible 


Sphere: All 

Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn + 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 10-foot path 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell discovers emanations of evil, or 
of good in the case of the reverse spell, from 
any creature, object, or area. Character 
alignment, however, is revealed only under 
unusual circumstances: characters who are 
strongly aligned, who do not stray from 
their faith, and who are of at least 9th level 
might radiate good or evil if intent upon ap- 
propriate actions. Powerful monsters, such 
as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emana- 
tions of evil or good, even if polymorphed. 
Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this 
power and negative force that enable them 
to continue existing. An evilly cursed object 
or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden 
trap or an unintelligent viper does not. 

The degree of evil (faint, moderate, 
strong, overwhelming) and possibly its gen- 
eral nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, 
etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelm- 
ing, the priest has a 10% chance per level of 
detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, 
chaotic). The duration of a detect evil (or 
detect good) spell is one turn plus five 
rounds per level of the priest. Thus a priest 
of 1st experience level can cast a spell with a 
15-round duration, at 2nd level he can cast a 
20-round duration spell, etc. The spell has a 


199 


Priest Spells (1st Level) 


path of detection 10 feet wide in the direc- 
tion in which the priest is facing. The priest 
must concentrate—stop, have quiet, and in- 
tently seek to detect the aura—for at least 
one round to receive a reading. 

The spell requires the use of the priest's 
holy symbol as its material component, 
with the priest holding it before him. 


Detect Magic (Divination) 


Sphere: Divination 

Range; 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn 

Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 10-foot path 
Saving Throw: None 


When the detect magic spell is cast, the 
priest detects magical radiations in a path 10 
feet wide and up to 30 yards long, in the di- 
rection he is facing. The intensity of the 
magic can be detected (dim, faint, moder- 
ate, strong, overwhelming). The caster has 
a 10% chance per level to determine the 
sphere of the magic, but unlike the wizard 
version of the spell, the type of magic (alter- 
ation, conjuration, etc.) cannot be divined. 
The caster can turn, scanning a 60° arc per 
round. A stone wall of one foot or more 
thickness, solid metal of one inch thickness, 
or a yard or more of solid wood blocks the 
spell. 

The spell requires the use of the priest's 
holy symbol. 


Detect Poison (Divination) 


Sphere: Divination 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the priest to determine 
if an object has been poisoned or is poison- 
ous. One object, or a 5-foot cubic mass, can 
be checked per round. The priest has a 5% 
chance per level of determining the exact 
type of poison. 

The material component is a strip of spe- 
cially blessed vellum, which turns black if 
poison is present. 


Priest Spells (1st Level) 


Detect Snares & Pits (Divination) 
Sphere: Divination 


Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 4 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 10-foot path, 40 feet long 
Saving Throw: None 


Upon casting this spell, the caster is able 
to detect snares, pits, deadfalls and similar 
hazards along a 10-foot-wide by 40-foot- 
long path. Such hazards include simple pits, 
deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures 
(e.g., trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant 
lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed 
of natural materials (mantraps, missile 
trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is 
directional—the caster must face the desired 
direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap 
is laid in that direction. The caster experi- 
ences a feeling of danger from the direction 
of a detected hazard, which increases as the 
danger is approached. The caster learns the 
general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or 
deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor 
how to disarm it. Close examination, how- 
ever, enables the caster to sense what 
intended actions might trigger it. The spell 
detects certain natural hazards—quicksand 
(snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of 
natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such 
as a cavern that floods during rain, an 
unsafe construction, or a naturally poison- 
ous plant, are not revealed. The spell does 
not detect magical traps (save those that 
operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the 
2nd-level spell trip and the 3rd-level spell, 
snare), nor those that are mechanically 
complex, nor does it detect snares or dead- 
falls that have been rendered safe or inac- 
tive. 

The caster must have his holy symbol to 
complete the spell. 


Endure Cold/Endure Heat (Alteration) 
Sphere: Protection 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1'/2 hours/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The creature receiving this spell is pro- 
tected from normal extremes of cold or heat 
(depending on which application the priest 
selects at the time of casting). The creature 
can stand unprotected in temperatures as 
low as —30° F. oras high as 130° F.(depend- 
ing on application) with no ill effect. Tem- 

’ peratures beyond these limits inflict 1 point 
of damage per hour of exposure for every 
degree beyond the limit. The spell is imme- 
diately cancelled if the recipient is affected 
by any non-normal heat or cold, such as 


magic, breath weapons, and so on. The can- 
cellation occurs regardless of the applica- 
tion and regardless of whether a heat or cold 
effect hits the character (e.g., an endure cold 
spell is cancelled by magical heat or fire as 
well as by magical cold). The recipient of 
the spell does not suffer the first 10 points of 
damage (after any applicable saving 
throws) from the heat or cold during the 
round in which the spell is broken. The spell 
ends instantly if either resist fire or resist 
cold is cast upon the recipient. 


Entangle (Alteration) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: 80 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 40-foot cube 
Saving Throw: 1/2 


By means of this spell, the caster is able to 
cause plants in the area of effect to entangle 
creatures within the area. The grasses, 
weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, 
and entwine about the creatures, holding 
them fast for the duration of the spell. Any 
creature entering the area is subject to this 
effect. A creature that rolls a successful sav- 
ing throw vs. spell can escape the area, 
moving at only 10 feet per round until out of 
the area. Exceptionally large (gargantuan) 
or strong creatures may suffer little or no 
distress from this spell, at the DM's option, 
based on the strength of the entangling 
plants. 

The material component is the caster’s 
holy symbol. 


Faerie Fire (Alteration) 


Sphere: Weather 

Range: 80 yards 

Component: V, M 

Duration: 4 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 10 sq. feet/level within 
a 40-foot radius 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to outline one 
or more objects or creatures with a pale 
glowing light. The number of subjects out- 
lined depends upon the number of square 
feet the caster can affect. Sufficient footage 
enables several objects or creatures to be 
outlined by the faerie fire spell, but one 
must be fully outlined before the next is 
begun, and all must be within the area of 
effect. Outlined objects or creatures are visi- 
ble at 80 yards in the dark, 40 yards if the 
viewer is near a bright light source. Out- 
lined creatures are easier to strike, thus 
opponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls in 
darkness (including moonlit nights) and a 
+1 bonus in twilight or better. Note that 


200 


outlining can render otherwise invisible 
creatures visible. However, it cannot out- 
line noncorporeal, ethereal, or gaseous 
creatures. Nor does the light come any- 
where close to sunlight. Therefore it has no 
special effect on undead or dark-dwelling 
creatures. The faerie fire can be blue, green, 
or violet according to the word of the caster 
at the time of casting. The faerie fire does 
not cause any harm to the object or creature 
thus outlined. 

The material component is a small piece 
of foxfire. 


Invisibility to Animals (Alteration) 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: Touch 

Components: S, M 

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 1 creature touched/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When an invisibility to animals spell is 
cast, the creature touched becomes totally 
undetectable by normal animals with Intel- 
ligences under 6. Normal animals includes 
giant-sized varieties, but it excludes any 
with magical abilities or powers. The 
enchanted individual is able to walk among 
such animals or pass through them as if he 
did not exist. For example, this individual 
could stand before the hungriest of lions or a 
tyrannosaurus rex and not be molested or 
even noticed. However, a nightmare, hell 
hound, or winter wolf would certainly be 
aware of the individual. For every level the 
caster has achieved, one creature can be ren- 
dered invisible. Any recipient attacking 
while this spell is in effect ends the spell 
immediately (for himself only). 

The material component of this spell is 
holly rubbed over the recipient. 


Invisibility to Undead (Abjuration) 


Sphere: Necromantic 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 6 rounds 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell causes affected undead to lose 
track of and ignore the warded creature for the 
duration of the spell. Undead of 4 or fewer Hit 
Dice are automatically affected, but those 
with more Hit Dice receive a saving throw vs. 
spell to avoid the effect. Note that a priest pro- 
tected by this spell cannot turn affected 
undead. The spell ends immediately if the 
recipient makes any attack, although casting 
spells such as cure light wounds, augury, or 
chant does not end the ward. 

The material component is the priest's 
holy symbol. 


Priest Spells (1st Level) 


Light (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Sun 

Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell causes a luminous glow within 
20 feet of the spell’s center. The area of light 
thus caused is equal in brightness to torch- 
light. Objects in darkness beyond this 
sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and 
shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a 
point selected by the caster, and he must 
have a line of sight or unobstructed path to 
that point when the spell is cast. Light can 
spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or 
almost any similar substance. The effect is 
immobile unless it is specifically centered on 
a movable object or mobile creature. If this 
spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable 
magic resistance and saving throws must be 
rolled. Successful resistance negates the 
spell, while a successful saving throw indi- 
cates that the spell is centered immediately 
behind the creature, rather than upon the 
creature itself. A light spell centered on the 
visual organs of a creature blinds it, reduc- 
ing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 
and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The 
caster can extinguish the light at any time by 
uttering a single word. Light spells are not 
cumulative—multiple castings do not pro- 
vide a brighter light. 

The spell is reversible, causing darkness 
in the same area and under the same condi- 
tions as the light spell, but with half the 
duration. Magical darkness is equal to that 
of an unlit interior room—pitch darkness. 
Any normal light source or magical light 
source of lesser intensity than full daylight 
does not function in magical darkness. A 
darkness spell cast directly against a light 
spell cancels both, and vice versa. 


Locate Animals or Plants 
(Divination) 


Sphere: Divination (Animal, Plant) 

Range: 100 yards + 20 yd./level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 20-foot-wide path 20 yards 
long/level 

Saving Throw: None 


The caster can find the direction and dis- 
tance of any one type of animal or plant he 
desires. The caster, facing in a direction, 
thinks of the animal or plant, and then 
knows if any such animal or plant is within 
range. If so, the exact distance and approxi- 


mate number present is learned. During 
each round of the spell’s duration, the caster 
can face in only one direction, i.e., only a 
20-foot-wide path can be known. The spell 
lasts one round per level of experience of the 
caster, while the length of the path is 100 
yards plus 20 yards per level of experience. 
(At the DM's option, some casters may be 
able to locate only those animals |or plants} 
associated closely with their own mythos.) 

The material component is the caster’s 
holy symbol. 

While the exact chance of locating a spe- 
cific type of animal or plant depends on the 
details and circumstances of the locale, the 
general frequency of the subject can be used 
as a guideline: common = 50%, uncom- 
mon = 30%, rare = 15%, and very rare = 
5%. Most herbs grow in temperate regions, 
while most spices grow in tropical regions. 
Most plants sought as spell components or 
for magical research are rare or very rare. 
The results of this spell are always deter- 
mined by the DM. 


Magical Stone (Enchantment) 


Sphere: Combat 
Range: 0 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By using this spell, the priest can tempo- 
rarily enchant up to three small pebbles, no 
larger than sling bullets. The magical stones 
can then be hurled or slung at an opponent. 
If hurled, they can be thrown up to 30 
yards, and all three can be thrown in one 
round. The character using them must roll 
normally to hit, although the magic of the 
stones enables any character to be proficient 
with them. The stones are considered +1 
weapons for determining if a creature can be 
struck (those struck only by magical weap- 
ons, for instance), although they do not 
have an attack or damage bonus. Each stone 
that hits inflicts 1d4 points of damage, 2d4 
points against undead. The magic in each 
stone lasts for but one-half hour or until 


The material components are the priest's 
holy symbol and three small pebbles, 
unworked by tools or magic of any type. 


Pass Without Trace 
(Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the recipient can 
move through any type of terrain—mud, 
snow, dust, etc.—and leave neither foot- 
prints nor scent. The area that is passed over 
radiates magic for 1d6 turns after the affect- 
ed creature passes. Thus, tracking a person 
or other creature covered by this spell is 
impossible by normal means. Of course, 
intelligent tracking techniques, such as 
using a spiral search pattern, can result in 
the trackers picking up the trail at a point 
where the spell has worn off. 

The material component of this spell is a 
sprig of pine or evergreen, which must be 
burned and the ashes powdered and scat- 
tered when the spell is cast. 


Protection From Evil (Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Protection 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds/Jevel 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, it creates a magical 
barrier around the recipient at a distance of 
one foot. The barrier moves with the recipi- 
ent and has three major effects: 

First, all attacks made by evil or evilly 
enchanted creatures against the protected 
creature receive a penalty of —2 to each 
attack roll, and any saving throws caused 
by such attacks are made by the protected 
creature with a +2 bonus. 

Second, any attempt to exercise mental 
control over the protected creature (if, for 
example, it had been charmed by a vampire) 
or to invade and take over its mind (as by a 
ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this 
spell. Note that the protection does not pre- 
vent a vampire’s charm itself, nor end it, but 
it does prevent the vampire from exercising 
mental control through the barrier. Like- 
wise, an outside life force is merely kept out, 
and would not be expelled if in place before 
the protection was cast. 

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact 
by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured 
nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, 
imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water 
weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the 
natural (body) weapon attacks of such crea- 
tures to fail and the creature to recoil if such 


Priest Spells (2nd Level) 


attacks require touching the protected crea- 
ture. Animals or monsters summoned or 
conjured by spells or similar magic are like- 
wise hedged from the character. This pro- 
tection ends if the protected character 
makes a melee attack against or tries to 
force the barrier against the blocked crea- 
ture. 

To complete this spell, the priest uses holy 
water or burning incense. 

This spell can be reversed to become pro- 
tection from good; the second and third 
benefits remain unchanged. 

The material components for the reverse 
are a circle of unholy water or smoldering 


dung. 


Purify Food & Drink (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: All 

Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level, 
10-foot-square area 

Saving Throw: None 


When cast, this spell makes spoiled, rot- 
ten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated 
food and water pure and suitable for eating 
and drinking. Up to one cubic foot of food 
and drink per level can be thus made suit- 
able for consumption. This spell does not 
prevent subsequent natural decay or spoil- 
age. Unholy water and similar food and 
drink of significance is spoiled by purify 
food and drink, but the spell has no effect on 
creatures of any type nor upon magical 
potions. 

The reverse of the spell is putrefy food 
and drink. This spoils even holy water. It 
likewise has no effect upon creatures or 
potions. 


Remove Fear (Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Charm 

Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 1 creature/4 levels 
Saving Throw: Special 


The priest instills courage in the spell 
recipient, raising the creature's saving throw 
rolls against magical fear attacks by +4 for 
one turn. If the recipient has recently (that 
day) failed a saving throw against such an 
attack, the spell immediately grants another 
saving throw, with a +4 bonus to the die 
roll. For every four levels of the caster, one 
creature can be affected by the spell (one 
creature at levels 1 through 4, two creatures 


at levels 5 through 8, etc.). 

The reverse of the spell, cause fear, causes 
one creature to flee in panic at maximum 
movement speed away from the caster for 
1d4 rounds, A successful saving throw 
against the reversed effect negates it, and 
any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of 
course, cause fear can be automatically 
countered by remove fear and vice versa. 

Neither spell has any effect on undead of 
any sort. 


Sanctuary (Abjuration) 


Sphere: Protection 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds +1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When the priest casts a sanctuary spell, 
any opponent attempting to strike or other- 
wise directly attack the protected creature 
must roll a saving throw vs. spell. If the sav- 
ing throw is successful, the opponent can 
attack normally and is unaffected by that 
casting of the spell. If the saving throw is 
failed, the opponent loses track of and total- 
ly ignores the warded creature for the dura- 
tion of the spell. Those not attempting to 
attack the subject remain unaffected. Note 
that this spell does not prevent the opera- 
tion of area attacks (fireball, ice storm, 
etc,). While protected by this spell, the sub- 
ject cannot take direct offensive action with- 
out breaking the spell, but may use 
non-attack spells or otherwise act in any 
way that does not violate the prohibition 
against offensive action. This allows a 
warded priest to heal wounds, for example, 
or to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a 
light in the area (not upon an opponent!), 
and so on. 

The components of the spell include the 
priest's holy symbol and a small silver mir- 
ror. 


Shillelagh (Alteration) 


Sphere: Combat, Plant 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 

Area of Effect: 1 normal oaken club 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to change his 
own oaken cudgel or unshod staff into a 
magical weapon that gains a +1 bonus to its 
attack roll and inflicts 2d4 points of damage 
on opponents up to man-sized, and 1d4+1 
points of damage on larger opponents. The 
spell inflicts no damage to the staff or cud- 
gel. The caster must wield the shillelagh, of 


course. 


202 


The material components of this spell are 
a shamrock leaf and the caster’s holy sym- 
bol. 


Second-Level Spells 


Ald (Necromancy, Conjuration) 


Sphere: Necromantic 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The recipient of this spell gains the benefit 
of a bless spell ( +1 to attack rolls and saving 
throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 addition- 
al hit points for the duration of the spell. 
The aid spell enables the recipient to actu- 
ally have more hit points than his full nor- 
mal total. The bonus hit points are lost first 
when the recipient takes damage; they can- 
not be regained by curative magic. Exam- 
ple: A Ist-level fighter has 8 hit points, 
suffers 2 points of damage (8 — 2 = 6), and 
then receives an aid spell that gives 5 addi- 
tional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit 
points, 5 of which are temporary. If he is 
then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit 
points and all 5 temporary hit points are 
lost. He then receives a cure light wounds 
spell that heals 4 points of damage, restor- 
ing him to his original 8 hit points. 

Note that the operation of the spell is 
unaffected by permanent hit point losses 
due to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss 
of a familiar, or the operation of certain arti- 
facts; the temporary hit point gain is figured 
from the new, lower total. 

The material components of this spell are 
a tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky sub- 
stance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus 
the priest's holy symbol. 


Priest Spells (2nd Level) 


Augury (Divination) 
Sphere: Divination 
Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2 rounds 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The priest casting an augury spell seeks to 
divine whether an action in the immediate 
future (within one-half hour) will be for the 
benefit of, or harmful to, the party. For 
example, if a party is considering the 
destruction of a weird seal that closes a por- 
tal, an augury spell can be used to find if 
weal or woe will be the immediate result. If 
the spell is successful, the DM yields some 
indication of the probable outcome: “weal,” 
“woe,” or possibly a cryptic puzzle or 
rhyme. The base chance for receiving a 
meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% for each 
level of the priest casting the spell, e.g., 71% 
at Ist level, 72% at 2nd, etc. Your DM deter- 
mines any adjustments for the particular 
conditions of each augury. 

For example, if the question is “Will we do 
well if we venture to the third level?” and a 
terrible troll guarding 10,000 s.p. and a 
shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the 
level (which the DM estimates the party 
could beat after a hard fight) the augury 
might be: “Great risk brings great reward.” 
If the troll is too strong for the party, the 
augury might be: “Woe and destruction 
await!" Likewise, a party casting several 
auguries about the same action in quick suc- 
cession might receive identical answers, 
regardless of the dice rolls. 

The material component for augury is a 
set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or 
similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value 
(which are not expended in casting). 


Barkskin (Alteration) 
Sphere: Protection, Plant 


Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When a priest casts the barkskin spell 
upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough 
as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to 
AC 6, plus 1 AC for every four levels of the 
priest: Armor Class 5 at 4th level, Armor 
Class 4 at 8th, and so on. This spell does not 
function in combination with normal armor 
or any magical protection. In addition, sav- 
ing throw rolls vs. all attack forms except 
magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be 
placed on the caster or on any other creature 
he touches. 

In addition to his holy symbol, the caster 


must have a handful of bark from an oak as 
the material component of the spell. 


Chant (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Combat 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Time of chanting 
Casting Time: 2 rounds 

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of the chant spell, the priest 
brings special favor upon himself and his 
party, and causes harm to his enemies. 
When the chant spell is completed, all 
attack and damage rolls and saving throws 
made by those in the area of effect who are 
friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, 
while those of the priest's enemies suffer —1 
penalties. This bonus/penalty continues as 
long as the caster continues to chant the 
mystic syllables and is stationary. An inter- 
ruption, however, such as an attack that 
succeeds and causes damage, grappling the 
chanter, or a silence spell, breaks the spell. 
Multiple chants are not cumulative; how- 
ever, if the 3rd-level prayer spell is spoken 
while a priest of the same religious persua- 
sion (not merely alignment!) is chanting, the 
effect is increased to +2 and —2. 


Charm Person or Mammal 
(Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: 80 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell affects any single person or 
mammal it is cast upon. The creature then 
regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally 
to be heeded and protected. The term per- 
son includes any bipedal human, demihu- 
man or humanoid of man-size or smaller, 
including brownies, dryads, dwarves, 
elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, 
halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, 
kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, 
sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 
10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre 
is not. 

The spell does not enable the caster to 
control the charmed creature as if it were an 
automaton, but any word or action of the 
caster is viewed in the most favorable way. 
Thus a charmed creature would not obey a 
suicide command, but might believe the 
caster if assured that the only chance to save 
the caster's life is for the creature to hold 
back an onrushing red dragon for “just a 
round or two” and if the charmed creature's 


203 


view of the situation suggests that this 
course of action still allows a reasonable 
chance of survival. 

The subject's attitudes and priorities are 
changed with respect to the caster, but basic 
personality and alignment are not. A 
request that a victim make itself defenseless, 
give up a valued item, or even use a charge 
from a valued item (especially against form- 
er associates or allies) might allow an imme- 
diate saving throw to see if the charm is 
thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature 
does not necessarily reveal everything it 
knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any 
request may be refused, if such refusal is in 
character and does not directly harm the 
caster. The victim's regard for the caster 
does not necessarily extend to the caster's 
friends or allies. The victim does not react 
well to the charmer’s allies making sugges- 
tions such as, “Ask him this question...,” nor 
does the charmed creature put up with ver- 
bal or physical abuse from the charmer’s 
associates, if this is out of character. 

Note also that the spell does not empower 
the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond 
those he normally has. The duration of the 
spell is a function of the charmed creature's 
Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving 
throw. The spell can be broken if a success- 
ful saving throw is rolled. This saving throw 
is checked on a periodic basis according to 
the creature's Intelligence, even if the caster 
has not overly strained the relationship. 


Period Between 
Intelligence Score Checks 
3 or less 3 months 


19 or more 


If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, 
the charmed creature by some overt action, 
or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast 
upon the charmed creature, the charm is 
broken automatically. 

If the subject of the charm person/charm 
mammal spell successfully rolls its saving 
throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated. 

. This spell, if used in conjunction with the 
animal friendship spell, can keep the animal 
near the caster’s home base, if the caster 
must leave for an extended period. 


Detect Charm (Divination) 
Reversible 

Sphere: Divination 

Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 creature/round 
Saving Throw: None 


When used by a priest, this spell can 
detect if a person or monster is under the 
influence of a charm spell, or similar control 
such as hypnosis, suggestion, beguiling, 
possession, etc. The creature rolls a saving 
throw vs. spell and, if successful, the caster 
learns nothing about that particular crea- 
ture from the casting. A caster who learns 
that a creature is being influenced has a 5% 
chance per level to determine the exact type 
of influence. Up to 10 different creatures can 
be checked before the spell wanes. If the 
creature is under more than one such effect, 
only the information that the charms exist is 
gained. The type (since there are conflicting 
emanations) is impossible to determine. 

The reverse of the spell, undetectable 
charm, completely masks all charms on a 
single creature for 24 hours. 


Dust Devil (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Elemental (Air) 
Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 2 rounds 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables a priest to conjure up a 
weak air elemental—a dust devil of AC 4, 2 
HD, MV 180 feet per round, one attack for 
1d4 points of damage, which can be hit by 
normal weapons. The dust devil appears as 
a small whirlwind one foot in diameter at its 
base, five feet tall, and three to four feet 
across at the top. It moves as directed by the 
priest, but dissipates if it is ever separated 
from the caster by more than 30 yards. Its 
winds are sufficient to put out torches, small 
campfires, exposed Janterns, and other 
small, open flames of non-magical origin. 
The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a 
creature in gaseous form at bay or push it 
away from the caster (though it cannot 
damage or disperse such a cloud), If skim- 
ming along the ground in an area of loose 
dust, sand, or ash, the dust devil picks up 
those particles and disperses them in a 10- 
foot-diameter cloud centered on itself. The 
cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures 
caught within are blinded while inside and 
for one round after they emerge. A spell- 
caster caught in the dust devil or its cloud 
while casting must make a saving throw vs. 


Priest Spells (2nd Level) 


spell to keep his concentration, or the spell 
is ruined. Any creature native to the ele- 
mental plane of Air—even another dust 
devil—can disperse a dust devil with a sin- 
gle hit. 


Enthrall (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Charm 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 90-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A priest using this spell can enthrall an 
audience that can fully understand his lan- 
guage. Those in the area of effect must save 
vs. spell or give the caster their undivided 
attention, totally ignoring their surround- 
ings. Those of a race or religion unfriendly 
to the caster’s have a +4 bonus to the roll. 
Any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Crea- 
tures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice, or 
with a Wisdom of 16 or better, are unaffect- 
ed. 

To cast the spell, the caster must speak 
without interruption for a full round. 
Thereafter, the enchantment lasts as long as 
the priest speaks, to a maximum of one 
hour. Those enthralled take no action while 
the priest speaks, and for 1d3 rounds there- 
after while they discuss the matter. Those 
entering the area of effect must also save or 
become enthralled. Those not enthralled are 
50% likely every turn to hoot and jeer in 
unison. If there is excessive jeering, the rest 
are allowed a new saving throw. The speech 
ends (but the 1d3 round delay still applies) if 
the priest is successfully attacked or per- 
forms any action other than speaking. 

If the audience is attacked, the spell ends 
and the audience reacts immediately, rolling 
a reaction check with respect to the source 
of the interruption, at a penalty of —10. 

Note: When handling a large number of 
saving throws for similar creatures, the DM 
can assume an average to save time: e.g., a 
crowd of 20 men with a base saving throw 
of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men 
enthralled and five not. 


Find Traps (Divination) 


Sphere: Divination 
Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 3 turns 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 10-foot path 
Saving Throw: None 

When a priest casts a find traps spell, all 
traps—concealed normally or magically— 
of magical or mechanical nature become 
apparent to him. Note that this spell is direc- 
tional, and the caster must face the desired 


204 


direction in order to determine if a trap is 
laid in that particular direction. 

A trap is any device or magical ward that 
meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden 
or unexpected result, the spellcaster would 
view the result as undesirable or harmful, 
and the harmful or undesirable result was 
specifically intended as such by the creator. 
Thus traps include alarms, glyphs, and simi- 
lar spells or devices. 

The caster learns the general nature of the 
trap (magical or mechanical) but not its 
exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close 
examination will, however, enable the cast- 
er to sense what intended actions might trig- 
ger it. Note that the caster’s divination is 
limited to his knowledge of what might be 
unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot 
predict actions of creatures (hence a con- 
cealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), 
nor are natural hazards considered traps (a 
cavern that floods during rain, a wall weak- 
ened by age, a naturally poisonous plant). If 
the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to 
identify magical wards (see the glyph of 
warding spell), this spell shows the form of 
the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect 
traps that have been disarmed or are other- 
wise inactive. 


Fire Trap (Abjuration, Evocation) 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent until discharged 
Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Object touched 
Saving Throw: 1/2 


Any closeable item (book, box, bottle, 
chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so 
forth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The 
spell is centered on a point selected by the 
spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have 
a second closure or warding spell placed 
upon it. A knock spell cannot affect a fire 
trap in any way—as soon as the offending 
party opens the item, the trap discharges. 
As with most magical traps, a thief has only 
half his normal find traps score to detect a 
fire trap. Failure to remove it successfully 
detonates it immediately. An unsuccessful 
dispel magic spell will not detonate the 
spell. When the trap is discharged, there will 
be an explosion of five-foot radius from the 
spell’s center. All creatures within this area 
must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 
1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the cast- 
er; half that total amount for creatures suc- 
cessfully saving. (Underwater, this ward 
inflicts half damage and creates a large 
cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not 
harmed by this explosion. 

The caster can use the trapped object 
without discharging it, as can any individ- 
ual to whom the spell was specifically 


Priest Spells (2nd Level) 


attuned when cast (the method usually 
involves a keyword). 

To place this spell, the caster must trace 
the outline of the closure with a stick of 
charcoal and touch the center of the effect. 
Attunement to another individual requires a 
hair or similar object from the individual. 

The material components are holly ber- 
ries. 


Flame Blade (Evocation) 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/2 levels 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: 3’ long, sword-like blade 
Saving Throw: None 


With this spell, the caster causes a blazing 
ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his 
hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it 
were a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits 
with the flame blade in melee combat, the 
creature struck suffers 1d4 + 4 points of 
damage, with a damage bonus of +2 (i.e., 
7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is 
especially vulnerable to fire. If the creature 
is protected from fire, the damage inflicted 
is reduced by 2 (i.e., 1d4 + 2 points). Fire 
dwellers and those using fire as an innate 
attack form suffer no damage from the 
spell. The flame blade can ignite combusti- 
ble materials such as parchment, straw, dry 
sticks, cloth, etc. However, it is not a magi- 
cal weapon in the normal sense of the term, 
so creatures (other than undead) struck only 
by magical weapons are not harmed by it. 
This spell does not function underwater. 

In addition to the caster’s holy symbol, 
the spell requires a leaf of sumac as a materi- 
al component. 


Goodberry (Alteration, Evocation) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 day + 1 day/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 2d4 fresh berries 
Saving Throw: None 


Casting a goodberry spell upon a handful 
of freshly picked berries makes 2d4 of them 
magical. The caster (as well as any other 
caster of the same faith and 3rd or higher 
level) can immediately discern which berries 
are affected. A detect magic spell discovers 
this also. Berries with the magic either 
enable a hungry creature of approximately 
man-size to eat one and be as well- 
nourished as if a full normal meal were eat- 
en, or else cure 1 point of physical damage 
from wounds or other similar causes, sub- 


ject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing 
in any 24-hour period. 

The reverse of the spell, badberry, causes 
2d4 rotten berries to appear wholesome, but 
each actually delivers 1 point of poison 
damage (no saving throw) if ingested. 

The material component of the spell is the 
caster’s holy symbol passed over the freshly 
picked, edible berries to be enspelled (blue- 
berries, blackberries, raspberries, currants, 
gooseberries, etc.). 


Heat Metal (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: 40 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 7 rounds 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


By means of the heat metal spell, the cast- 
er is able to make ferrous metal (iron, iron 
alloys, steel) extremely hot. Elven 
mail is not affected, and magical metal 
armor receives an item saving throw vs. 
magical fire. If this is successful, the heat 
metal spell does not affect it. 

On the first round of the spell, the metal 
merely becomes very warm and uncomfor- 
table to touch (this is also the effect on the 
last melee round of the spell’s duration). 
During the second and sixth (next to the 
last) rounds, heat causes blisters and dam- 
age; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, 
the metal becomes searing hot, causing 
damage to exposed flesh, as shown below: 


Metal Temperature Damage per Round 


very warm none 
hot 1d4 points 
searing* 2d4 points 


(*) On the final round of searing, the 
afflicted creature must roll a successful sav- 
ing throw vs. spell or suffer one of the fol- 
lowing disabilities: hand or foot—unusable 
for 2d4 days, body—disabled 1d4 days, 
head—unconscious 1d4 turns. This effect 
can be completely removed by the Sth-level 
priest heal spell or by normal rest. 


Note also that materials such as wood, 
leather, or flammable cloth smolder and 
burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such 
materials cause searing damage to exposed 
flesh on the next round. Fire resistance 
(spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from 
fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat 
metal spell, as does immersion in water or 
snow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm 
spell. This version of the spell does not func- 
tion underwater. For every two experience 
levels of the caster, the metal of one man- 
sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and 


205 


armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50 
pounds weight). Thus, a 3rd-level caster 
would affect one such creature, a 4th- or 
5th-level caster two, etc. 

The reverse of the spell, chill metal, 
counters a heat metal spell or else causes 
metal to act as follows: 


Metal Temperature Damage per Round 


cold none 
icy 1-2 hit points 
ing* 1d4 hit points 


(*) On the final round of freezing, the 
afflicted creature must roll a successful sav- 
ing throw vs. spell or suffer from the numb- 
ing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of 
all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM 
rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 
1d4 days. During this time, the character's 
grip is extremely weak and he cannot use 
that hand for fighting or any other activity 
requiring a firm grasp. 


The chill metal spell is countered by a 
resist cold spell, or by any great heat— 
proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere 
torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of 
fire spell, etc. Underwater, this version of 
the spell inflicts no damage, but ice immedi- 
ately forms around the affected metal, 
exerting an upward buoyancy. 


Hold Person (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Charm 
Range: 120 yards 
Components, V, S, M 
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1d4 persons 

in a 20-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihu- 
mans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immo- 
bile and in place for five or more rounds. 

The hold person spell affects any bipedal 
human, demihuman, or humanoid of man- 
size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, 
dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, 
half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, 
humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, 
pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. 
Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, 
while an ogre could not. 

The effect is centered on a point selected 
by the caster, and it affects persons selected 
by the caster within the area of effect. If the 
spell is cast at three persons, each gets a nor- 
mal saving throw; if only two persons are 
being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw 
with a —1 penalty; if the spell is cast at but 
one person, the saving throw die roll suffers 
—2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for 
Wisdom. Those who succeed on their sav- 
ing throws are totally unaffected by the 
spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. 


Priest Spells (2nd Level) 


Held creatures cannot move or speak, but 
they remain aware of events around them 
and can use abilities not requiring motion or 
speech. Being held does not prevent the 
worsening of the subjects’ condition due to 
wounds, disease, or poison. The priest cast- 
ing the hold person spell can end the spell 
with a single utterance at any time; other- 
wise the duration is two rounds at 1st level, 
four rounds at 2nd level, six rounds at 3rd 
level, etc. 

The spellcaster needs a small, straight 
piece of iron as the material component of 
this spell. 


Know Alignment (Divination) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Divination 

Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn 

Casting time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 creature or object 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A know alignment spell enables the priest 
to exactly read the aura of a creature or an 
aligned object (unaligned objects reveal 
nothing). The caster must remain stationary 
and concentrate on the subject for a full 
round. If the creature rolls a successful sav- 
ing throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing 
about that particular creature from the cast- 
ing. Certain magical devices negate the 
power of the know alignment spell. 

The reverse, undetectable alignment, 
conceals the alignment of an object or crea- 
ture for 24 hours. 


Messenger (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: 20 yards/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 day/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell enables the priest to call upon a 
tiny (size T) creature of at least animal intel- 
ligence to act as his messenger. The spell 
does not affect giant animals and it does not 
work on creatures of low (i.e., 5) Intelli- 
gence or higher. If the creature is within 
range, the priest, using some type of food 
desirable to the animal as a lure, can call the 
animal to come. The animal is allowed a 
saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is 
failed, the animal advances toward the 
priest and awaits his bidding. The priest can 
communicate with the animal in a crude 
fashion, telling it to go to a certain place, 
but directions must be simple. The spell- 
caster can attach some small item or note to 
the animal. If so instructed, the animal will 


then wait at that location until the duration 
of the spell expires. (Note that unless the in- 
tended recipient of a message is expecting a 
messenger in the form of a small animal or 
bird, the carrier may be ignored.) When the 
spell’s duration expires, the animal or bird 
returns to its normal activities. The in- 
tended recipient of a message gains no com- 
munication ability. 


Obscurement (Alteration) 


Sphere: Weather 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S 
Duration: 4 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell causes a misty vapor to arise 
around the caster. It persists in this locale 
for four rounds per caster level and reduces 
the visibility ranges of all types of vision (in- 
cluding infravision) to 2d4 feet. The ground 
area affected by the spell is a square progres- 
sion based on the caster’s level: a 10’ x 10’ 
area at Ist level, a 20’ x 20 ' area at 2nd 
level, a 30’ x 30' area at 3rd level, and so on. 
The height of the vapor is restricted to 10 
feet, although the cloud will otherwise ex- 
pand to fill confined spaces. A strong wind 
(such as the 3rd-level wizard spell, gust of 
wind, can cut the duration of an obscure- 
ment spell by 75%. This spell does not func- 
tion under water. 


Produce Flame (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: 0 

Components; V, S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


A bright flame, equal in brightness to a 
torch, springs forth from the caster’s palm 
when he casts a produce flame spell. The 
flame does not harm the caster, but it is hot 
and it causes the combustion of flammable 
materials (paper, cloth, dry wood, oil, etc.). 
The caster is capable of hurling the magical 
flame as a missile, with a range of 40 yards 
(considered short range). The flame flashes 
on impact, igniting combustibles within a 
three-foot diameter of its center of impact, 
and then it goes out. A creature struck by 
the flame suffers 1d4+1 points of damage 
and, if combustion occurs, must spend a 
round extinguishing the fire or suffer addi- 
tional damage assigned by the DM until the 
fire is extinguished. A miss is resolved as a 
grenade-like missile. If any duration re- 
mains to the spell, another flame immedi- 
ately appears in the caster’s hand. The caster 
can hurl a maximum of one flame per level, 


206 


but no more than one flame per round. 

The caster can snuff out magical flame 
any time he desires, but fire caused by the 
flame cannot be so extinguished. This spell 
does not function under water. 


Resist Fire/Resist Cold (Alteration) 


Sphere: Protection 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is placed upon a creature 
by a priest, the creature's body is toughened 
to withstand heat or cold, as chosen by the 
caster. Complete immunity to mild condi- 
tions (standing naked in the snow or reach- 
ing into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note) 
is gained. The recipient can somewhat resist 
intense heat or cold (whether natural or 
magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, 
a large amount of burning oil, i 
swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor 
swarms, red dragon's breath, frostbrand 
swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white 
dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the 
temperature affects the creature to some ex- 
tent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus 
of +3 to saving throws against such attack 
forms and all damage sustained is reduced 
by 50%; therefore, if the saving throw is 
failed, the creature sustains one-half dam- 
age, and if the saving throw is successful, 
only one-quarter damage is sustained. Re- 
sistance to fire lasts for one round for each 
experience level of the priest placing the 
spell. 

The caster needs a drop of mercury as the 
material component of this spell. 


Silence, 15' Radius (Alteration) 


Sphere: Guardian 

Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: None 


Upon casting this spell, complete silence 
prevails in the affected area. All sound is 
stopped: conversation is impossible, spells 
cannot be cast (or at least not those with 
verbal components, if the optional compo- 
nent rule is used), and no noise whatsoever 
issues from or enters the area. The spell can 
be cast into the air or upon an object, but 
the effect is stationary unless cast on a mo- 
bile object or creature. The spell lasts two 
rounds for each level of experience of the 
priest. The spell can be centered upon a 
creature, and the effect then radiates from 
the creature and moves as it moves. An un- 


Priest Spells (2nd Level) 


willing creature receives a saving throw 
against the spell. If the saving throw is suc- 
cessful, the spell effect is centered about one 
foot behind the position of the subject crea- 
ture at the instant of casting. This spell pro- 
vides a defense against sound-based attacks, 
such as harpy singing, horn of blasting, etc. 


Slow Poison (Necromancy) 


Sphere: Healing 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 hour/level 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is placed upon a poisoned 
individual, it greatly slows the effects of 
venom, if it is cast upon the victim before 
the poison takes full effect. (This period, 
known as the onset time, is known to the 
DM.) While this spell does not neutralize 
the venom, it does prevent it from substan- 
tially harming the individual for the dura- 
tion of its magic in hopes that, during that 
period, a full cure can be accomplished. 

The material components of the slow poi- 
son spell are the priest's holy symbol and a 
bud of garlic that must be crushed and 
smeared on the wound (or eaten if poison 


was ingested). 


Snake Charm (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, a hypnotic pattern 
is set up that causes one or more snakes to 
cease all activity except a semi-erect, swaying 
movement. If the snakes are charmed while 
in a torpor, the duration of the spell is 1d4 +2 
turns; if the snakes are not torpid, but are not 
aroused and angry, the charm lasts 1d3 turns; 
if the snakes are angry or attacking, the 
snake charm spell lasts 1d4+4 rounds. The 
priest casting the spell can charm snakes 
whose total hit points are less than or equal 
to those of the priest. On the average, a Ist- 
level priest could charm snakes with a total 
of 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd-level priest could 
charm 9 hit points, etc. The hit points can be 
those of a single snake or those of several of 
the reptiles, but the total hit points cannot ex- 
ceed those of the priest casting the spell. A 
23-hit point caster charming a dozen 2-hit 
point snakes would charm 11 of them. This 
spell is also effective against any ophidian or 
ophidianoid monster, such as naga, couatl, 
etc., subject to magic resistance, hit points, 
and so forth. 


Variations of this spell may exist, allow- 
ing other creatures significant to a particular 
mythos to be affected. Your DM will inform 
you if such spells exist. 


Speak With Animals (Alteration) 


Sphere: Animal, Divination 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 animal within 
30-foot radius of priest 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell empowers the priest to compre- 
hend and communicate with any warm- or 
cold-blooded normal or giant animal that is 
not mindless. The priest is able to ask ques- 
tions and receive answers of the creature, al- 
though friendliness and cooperation are by 
no means assured. Furthermore, terseness 
and evasiveness are likely in basically wary 
and cunning creatures (the more stupid ones 
will instead make inane comments). If the 
animal is friendly or of the same general 
alignment as the priest, there is a possibility 
that the animal will do some favor or service 
for the priest. This possibility is determined 
by the DM, Note that this spell differs from 
the speak with monsters spell, for this spell 
allows conversation only with normal or gi- 
ant, non-fantastic creatures such as apes, 
bears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on. 


Spiritual Hammer (Invocation) 


Sphere: Combat 

Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


By calling upon his deity, the caster of a 
spiritual hammer spell brings into existence 
a field of force shaped vaguely like a ham- 
mer. As long as the caster concentrates upon 
the hammer, it strikes at any opponent 
within its range, as desired. Each round the 
caster can choose to attack the same target 
as the previous round or switch to a new tar- 
get that he can see anywhere within his max- 
imum range. The spiritual hammer’s chance 
to successfully hit is equal to that of the 
caster, without any Strength bonuses. In ad- 
dition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a 
bonus of +1 for every six experience levels 
(or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total 
of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the dam- 
age roll for a 13th-level caster. The base 
damage inflicted when it scores a hit is ex- 
actly the same as a normal war hammer 
(1d4+1 vs. opponents of man size or 
smaller, 1d4 upon larger opponents, plus 
the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in 


207 


the same direction as the caster is facing, so 
if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear 
attack are gained along with the loss of any 
modifications to the target's AC for shield 
and Dexterity. 

As soon as the caster ceases concentra- 
tion, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dis- 
pel magic spell that includes either the caster 
or the force in its area of effect has a chance 
to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an at- 
tacked creature has magic resistance, the re- 
sistance is checked the first time the spiritual 
hammer strikes. If the hammer is success- 
fully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the 
hammer has its normal full effect for the du- 
ration of the spell. 

The material component of this spell is a 
normal war hammer that the priest must 
hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea 
to his deity. The hammer disappears when 
the spell is cast. 


Trip (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 1 object up to 10 feet long 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This magic must be cast upon a normal 
object—a length of vine, a stick, a pole, a 
rope, or a similar object. The spell causes 
the object to rise slightly off the ground or 
floor it is resting on to trip most creatures 
crossing it, if they fail their saving throws 
vs. spell. Note that only as many creatures 
can be tripped as are actually stepping 
across the enchanted object. Thus a three- 
foot-long piece of rope could trip only one 
man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a 
very rapid pace (running) when tripped suf- 
fer 1 point of damage and are stunned for 
1d4 +1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is 
very hard (if it is turf or other soft material, 
they are merely stunned for the rest of that 
round). Very large creatures, such as ele- 
phants, are not at all affected by a trip. The 
object continues to trip all creatures passing 
over it, including the spellcaster, for as long 
as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware 
of the object and its potential adds a +4 bo- 
nus to its saving throw roll when crossing 
the object. The enchanted object is 80% un- 
detectable unless a means that detects magi- 
cal traps is employed or the operation of the 
spell is observed. This spell does not func- 


tion under water. 


Warp Wood (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: 10 yards/level 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


When this spell is cast, the priest causes a 
volume of wood to bend and warp, perma- 
nently destroying its straightness, form, and 
strength. The range of a warp wood spell is 
10 yards for each level of experience of the 
caster. It affects approximately a 15-inch 
shaft of wood of up to one-inch diameter 
per level of the caster. Thus, at 1st level, a 
caster might be able to warp an hand axe 
handle or four crossbow bolts; at Sth level, 
he could warp the shaft of a typical spear. 
Note that boards or planks can also be af- 
fected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat 
or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are 
useless; warped melee weapons suffer a —4 
penalty to their attack rolls. 

Enchanted wood is affected only if the 
spellcaster is of higher level than the caster 
of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster 
has a 20% cumulative chance of success per 
level of difference (20% if one level higher, 
40% if two levels higher, etc.). Thus, a door 
magically held or wizard locked by a 5th- 
level wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a 
warp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest. 
Wooden magical items are considered en- 
chanted at 12th level (or better). Extremely 
powerful items, such as artifacts, are unaf- 
fected by this spell. 

The reversed spell, straighten wood, 
straightens bent or crooked wood, or re- 
verses the effects of a warp wood spell, sub- 
ject to the same restrictions. 


Withdraw (Alteration) 


Sphere: Protection 

:0 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of a withdraw spell, the priest 
in effect alters the flow of time with regard 
to himself. While but one round of time 
passes for those not affected by the spell, the 
priest is able to spend two rounds, plus one 
round per level, in contemplation. Thus, a 
Sth-level priest can withdraw for seven 
rounds to cogitate on some matter while one 
round passes for all others. (The DM should 
allow the player one minute of real time per 
round withdrawn to ponder some problem 
or question. No discussion with other play- 


Priest Spells (3rd Level) 


ers is permitted.) Note that while affected 
by the withdraw spell, the caster can use 
only the following spells: any divination 
spell or any curing or healing spell, the latter 
on himself only. The casting of any of these 
spells in a different fashion (e.g., a cure light 
wounds spell bestowed upon a companion) 
negates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the 
withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, be- 
come invisible, or engage in actions other 
than thinking, reading, and the like. He can 
be affected by the actions of others, losing 
any Dexterity or shield bonus. Any success- 
ful attack upon the caster breaks the spell. 


Wyvern Watch (Evocation) 


Sphere: Guardian 

Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 8 hours or until strike 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


This spell is known as wyvern watch be- 
cause of the insubstantial haze brought 
forth by its casting, which vaguely resem- 
bles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard 
some area against intrusion. Any creature 
approaching within 10 feet of the guarded 
area may be affected by the “wyvern.” Any 
creature entering the guarded area must roll 
a successful saving throw vs. spell or stand 
paralyzed for one round per level of the 
caster, until freed by the spellcaster, by a 
dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis 
spell. A successful saving throw indicates 
that the subject creature was missed by the 
attack of the wyvern-form, and the spell re- 
mains in place. As soon as a subject creature 
is successfully struck by the wyvern-form, 
the paralysis takes effect and the force of the 
spell dissipates. The spell force likewise dis- 
sipates if no intruder is struck by the 
wyvern-form for eight hours after the spell 
is cast. Any creature approaching the space 
being guarded by the wyvern-form may be 
able to detect its presence before coming 
close enough to be attacked; this chance of 
detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twi- 
light conditions, and 0% in darkness. 

The material component is the priest's 
holy symbol.

Third-Level Spells 


Animate Dead (Necromancy) 


Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration; Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell creates the lowest of the undead 
monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually 
from the bones or bodies of dead humans, 
demihumans, or humanoids. The spell 
causes these remains to become animated 
and obey the simple verbal commands of 
the caster, regardless of how they communi- 
cated in life. The skeletons or zombies can 
follow the caster, remain in an area and at- 
tack any creature (or just a specific type of 
creature) entering the place, etc. The un- 
dead remain animated until they are de- 
stroyed in combat or are turned; the magic 
cannot be dispelled. 

The priest can animate one skeleton or 
one zombie for each experience level he has 
attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit 
Dice are animated, the number is deter- 
mined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal 
forms have the Hit Dice of the original crea- 
ture, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit 
Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 
12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four 
zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. 
Note that this is based on the standard racial 
Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer 
would be animated as a skeleton or zombie 
of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class 
or racial abilities. The caster can, alterna- 
tively, animate two small animal skeletons 
(1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experi- 
ence he has achieved. 

The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece 
of flesh of the type of creature being ani- 
mated, and a pinch of bone powder or a 
bone shard to complete the spell. Casting 


this spell is not a good act, and only evil 
priests use it frequently. 


Call Lightning (Alteration) 
Sphere: Weather 
Range: 0 


Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 360-foot radius 
Saving Throw: 1/2 


When a call lightning spell is cast, there 
must be a storm of some sort in the area—a 
rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and 
cloudy conditions, or even a tornado 
(including a whirlwind formed by a djinn or 
air elemental of 7 Hit Dice or more). The 
caster is then able to call down bolts of light- 
ning. The caster can call down one bolt per 
turn. The caster need not call a bolt of light- 
ning immediately—other actions, even 
spellcasting, can be performed; however, 
the caster must remain stationary and con- 
centrate for a full round each time a bolt is 
called. The spell has a duration of one turn 
per caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points 
of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 
points for each of the caster’s experience 
levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a 
6d8 bolt (2d8 + 4d8). 

The bolt of lightning flashes down in a 
vertical stroke at whatever distance the 
spellcaster decides, up to 360 yards away. 
Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the 
path or the point where the lightning strikes 
suffers full damage unless a successful sav- 
ing throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case 
only one-half damage is taken. 

Because it requires a storm overhead, this 
spell can only be used outdoors. It does not 
function under ground or under water. 


Continual Light (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Sun 

Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 60-foot-radius globe 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell is similar to a light spell, except 
that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts 
until negated by magical darkness or by a 
dispel magic spell. Creatures with penalties 
in bright light suffer them in this spell’s area 
of effect. As with the light spell, this can be 
cast into air, onto an object, or at a creature. 
In the third case, the continual light affects 
the space about one foot behind a creature 
that successfully rolls its saving throw vs. 
spell (a failed saving throw means the con- 
tinual light is centered on the creature and 


Priest Spells (3rd Level) 


moves as it moves). Note that this spell also 
blinds a creature if it is successfully cast 
upon the creature's visual organs. If the spell 
is cast on a small object that is then placed in 
a light-proof covering, the spell effects are 
blocked until the covering is removed. 

Continual light brought into an area of 
magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the 
darkness so that the otherwise prevailing 
light conditions exist in the overlapping 
areas of effect. A direct casting of a contin- 
ual light spell against a similar or weaker 
magical darkness cancels both. 

This spell eventually consumes the mate- 
rial it is cast upon, but the process takes far 
longer than the time in a typical campaign. 
Extremely hard and expensive materials 
might last hundreds or even thousands of 
years. 

The reverse spell, continual darkness, 
causes complete absence of light (pitch 
blackness), similar to the darkness spell but 
of greater duration and area. 


Create Food & Water (Alteration) 


Sphere: Creation 

Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the priest causes 
food and water to appear. The food thus 
created is highly nourishing if rather bland; 
each cubic foot of the material sustains three 
human-sized creatures or one horse-sized 
creature for a full day. The food decays and 
becomes inedible within 24 hours, although 
it can be restored for another 24 hours by 
casting a purify food and water spell upon 
it. The water created by this spell is the same 
as that created by the 1st-level priest spell 
create water. For each experience level the 
priest has attained, one cubic foot of food or 
water is created by the spell. A 2nd-level 
priest could create one cubic foot of food 
and one cubic foot of water. 


Cure Blindness or Deafness 
(Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: Special 
By touching the creature afflicted, the 
priest employing the spell can permanently 
cure some forms of blindness or deafness. 
This spell does not restore or repair visual or 


209 


auditory organs damaged by injury or dis- 
ease. 

Its reverse, cause blindness or deafness, 
requires a successful touch (successful 
attack roll) on the victim. If the victim rolls 
a successful saving throw, the effect is 
negated. If the saving throw is failed, a non- 
damaging magical blindness or deafness 
results. 

A deafened creature suffers a —1 penalty 
to surprise rolls, a +1 penalty to its initia- 
tive rolls, a 20% chance of spell failure for 
spells with verbal components, and can 
react only to what it can see or feel. A blind- 
ed creature suffers a — 4 penalty to its attack 
rolls, a +4 penalty to its Armor Class, anda 
+2 penalty to its initiative rolls. 


Cure Disease (Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Necromantic 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration; Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to cure most 
diseases by placing his hand upon the dis- 
eased creature. The affliction rapidly disap- 
pears thereafter, making the cured creature 
whole and well in from one turn to 10 days, 
depending on the type of disease and the 
state of its advancement when the cure took 
place. (The DM must adjudicate these con- 
ditions.) The spell is also effective against 
parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot 
grubs, and others. When cast by a priest of 
at least 12th level, this spell cures lycanthro- 
py if cast within three days of the infection. 
Note that the spell does not prevent reoccur- 
rence of a disease if the recipient is again 
exposed 


The reverse of the cure disease spell is 
cause disease. To be effective, the priest 
must touch the intended victim, and the vic- 
tim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The 
severity of the disease is decided by the 
priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact 
details of the disease are decided by the DM, 
but the following are typical: 

* Debilitating—The disease takes effect in 
1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 
point of Strength per hour until his Strength 
is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the 
recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a 
creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% 
of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 
10% of its original hit points. If the disease 
also affects hit points, use the more severe 
penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 
weeks. 

° Fatal—This wasting disease is effective 
immediately. Infected creatures receive no 
benefit from cure wound spells while the 


Priest Spelis (3rd Level) 


disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% 
of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal 
within 1d6 months and can be cured only by 
magical means. Each month the disease pro- 
gresses, the creature loses 2 points of Cha- 
risma, permanently. 

The inflicted disease can be cured by the 
cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be 
ca 


Dispel Magic (Abjuration) 
Sphere: Protection 


Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube or 1 item 
Saving Throw: None 


When a priest casts this spell, it has a 
chance to neutralize or negate the magic it 
comes in contact with as follows: 

First, it has a chance to remove spells and 
spell-like effects (including device effects 
and innate abilities) from creatures or 
objects. Second, it may disrupt the casting 
or use of these in the area of effect at the 
instant the dispel is cast. Third, it may 
destroy magical potions (which are treated 
as 12th level for purposes of this spell). 

Each effect or potion in the spells area is 
checked to determine if it is dispelled. The 
caster can always dispel his own magic; oth- 
erwise the chance depends on the difference 
in level between the magical effect and the 
caster. The base chance of successfully dis- 
pelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster 
is higher level than the creator of the effect 
to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted 
from this base number needed. If the caster 
is lower level, then the difference is added to 
the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds 
and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a 
caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is 
trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the 
effect from being dispelled. 

A dispel magic can affect only a specially 
enchanted item (such as a magical scroll, 
ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, 
weapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast 
directly upon the item. This renders the item 
nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item 
possessed or carried by a creature has the 
creature's saving throw against this effect; 
otherwise it is automatically rendered non- 
operational. An interdimensional interface 
(such as a bag of holding) rendered non- 
operational is temporarily closed. Note that 
an item's physical properties are unchanged: 
a nonoperational magical sword is still a 
sword. 

Artifacts and relics are not subject to this 
spell, but some of their spell-like effects may 
be, at the DM's option.

Feign Death (Necromancy) 


Sphere: Necromantic 

Range: Touch 

Component: V 

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1/2 

Area of Effect: Person touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster or any 
other willing person can be put into a cata- 
leptic state that is impossible to distinguish 
from actual death. Although the person 
affected can smell, hear, and know what is 
going on, no feeling or sight of any sort is 
possible; thus, any wounding or mistreat- 
ment of the body is not felt, no reaction 
occurs, and damage is only one-half nor- 
mal. In addition, paralysis, poison, or 
energy level drain does not t a person 
under the influence of this spell, but poison 
injected or otherwise introduced into the 
body becomes effective when the spell recip- 
ient is no longer under the influence of this 
spell, although a saving throw is permitted. 
However, the spell offers no protection 
from causes of certain death—being crushed 
under a landslide, etc. Only a willing indi- 
vidual can be affected by a feign death spell. 
The priest is able to end the spell effect at 
any time, but it requires a full round for 
bodily functions to begin again. 

Note that, unlike the wizard version of 
this spell, only people can be affected, and 
that those of any level can be affected by the 
priest casting this spell.

Flame Walk (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round + 1/level 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Creature(s) touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster 
empowers one or more creatures to with- 
stand nonmagical fires of temperatures up 
to 2,000° F. (enabling them to walk upon 
molten lava). It also confers a +2 bonus to 
saving throws against magical fire and 
reduces damage from such fires by one-half, 
even if the saving throw is failed. For every 
experience level above the minimum 
required to cast the spell (Sth), the priest can 
affect an additional creature. This spell is 
not cumulative with resist fire spells or simi- 
lar protections. 

The material components of the spell are 
the priest's holy symbol and at least 500 gp 
of powdered ruby per affected creature. 


Glyph of Warding 
(Abjuration, Evocation) 


Sphere: Guardian 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent until discharged 
Casting Time: Special 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: Special 


A glyph of warding is a powerful inscrip- 
tion magically drawn to prevent unauthor- 
ized or hostile creatures from passing, 
entering, or opening. It can be used to guard 
a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap 
on a chest or box. 

The priest must set the conditions of the 
ward; typically any creature violating the 
warded area without speaking the name of 
the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A 
successful saving throw vs. spell enables the 
creature to escape the effects of the glyph. 
Glyphs can be set according to physical 
characteristics, such as creature type, size, 
and weight. Glyphs can also be set with 
respect to good or evil, or to pass those of 
the caster’s religion. They cannot be set 


Priest Spells (3rd Level) 


according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multi- 
ple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; 
although if a cabinet had three drawers, 
each could be separately warded. 

When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a 
tracery of faintly glowing lines around the 
warding sigil. For every five square feet of 
area to be protected, one round is required 
to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The 
caster can affect an area equal to a square 
the sides of which are the same as his level, 
in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform 
to any shape up to the limitations of the 
caster’s total square footage. Thus a 6th- 
level caster could place a glyph on a 6' x 6' 
square, shape it into a rectangle 4’ x 9’, a 
band 2’ by 18’, or a single strip 1’ by 36’. 
When the spell is completed, the glyph and 
tracery become invisible. 

The priest traces the glyph with incense, 
which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, 
must be sprinkled with powdered diamond 
(at least 2,000 gp worth). 

Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of 
electrical damage per level of the spellcaster, 
explode for a like amount of fire damage, 
paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The 
DM may allow any harmful priest spell 
effect to be used as a glyph, provided the 
caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. 
Successful saving throws either reduce 
effects by one-half or negate them, accord- 
ing to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot 
be affected or bypassed by such means as 
physical or magical probing, though they 
can be dispelled by magic and foiled by 
high-level thieves using their find-and- 
remove-traps skill. 

The DM may decide that the exact glyphs 
available to a priest depend on his religion, 
and he might make new glyphs available 
according to the magical research rules. 


Hold Animal (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: 80 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 1 to 4 animals in a 
40-foot cube 

Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell, the caster holds 
one to four animals rigid. Animals affected 
are normal or giant-sized mammals, birds, 
or reptiles, but not monsters such as cen- 
taurs, gorgons, harpies, naga, etc. Apes, 
bears, crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant 
beavers, and similar animals are subject to 
this spell. The hold lasts for two rounds per 
caster level. The caster decides how many 
animals can be affected, but the greater the 
number, the better chance each has to suc- 
cessfully save against the spell. Each animal 
gets a saving throw: if only one is the subject 


of the spell, it has a penalty of —4 to its roll; 
if two are subject, each receives a penalty of 
—2 to its roll; if three are subject, each 
receives a penalty of —1 to its roll; if four 
are subject, each gets an unmodified saving 
throw. 

A maximum body weight of 400 pounds 
(100 pounds for nonmammals) per animal 
per caster level can be affected—e.g., an 
8th-level caster can affect up to four 3,200- 
pound mammals or a like number of 800- 
pound nonmammals, such as birds or 
reptiles. 


Locate Object (Divination) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Divination 

Range: 60 yards + 10 yd./level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 8 hours 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 1 object 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell helps locate a known or famil- 
iar object. The priest casts the spell, slowly 
turns, and will sense when he is facing in the 
direction of the object to be located, provid- 
ed the object is within range—e.g., 90 yards 
for 3rd-level priests, 100 yards for 4th, 110 
yards for Sth, etc. The spell locates such 
objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, 
weapons, or even a ladder or stairway. 
Once the caster has fixed in his mind the 
item sought, the spell locates only that item. 
Attempting to find a specific item, such as a 
kingdom's crown, requires an accurate men- 
tal image. If the image is not close enough to 
the actual item, the spell does not work; in 
short, desired but unique objects cannot be 
located by this spell unless they are known 
by the caster. The spell is blocked by lead. 

The casting requires the use of a piece of 
lodestone. 

The reversal, obscure object, hides an 
object from location by spell, crystal ball, 
or similar means for eight hours. The caster 
must touch the object being concealed. 

Neither application of the spell affects liv- 
ing creatures. 


Magical Vestment (Enchantment) 


Sphere: Protection 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enchants the caster’s vestment, 
providing protection at least the equivalent 
of chain mail (AC 5). The vestment gains a 
+1 enchantment for each three levels of the 
priest beyond Sth level, to a maximum of 


211 


AC 1 at 17th level. The magic lasts for five 
rounds per level of the caster, or until the 
caster loses consciousness. If the vestment is 
worn with other armors, only the best AC 
(either the armor or the vestment) is used— 
this protection is not cumulative with any 
other AC protection. 

The material components are the vest- 
ment to be enchanted and the priest's holy 
symbol, which are not expended. 


Meld Into Stone (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Earth) 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 8 rounds + 1d8 rounds 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Caster 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the priest to meld his 
body and possessions into a single block of 
stone. The stone must be large enough to 
accommodate his body in all three dimen- 
sions. When casting is complete, the priest 
and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving 
gear merge with the stone. If either condi- 
tion is violated, the spell fails and is wasted. 

While in the stone, the priest remains in 
contact, however tenuous, with the face of 
the stone through which he melded. The 
priest remains aware of the passage of time. 
Nothing that goes on outside the stone can 
be seen or heard, however. Minor physical 
damage to the stone does not harm the 
priest, but its partial destruction, if enough 
so that the caster no longer fits, expels the 
priest with 4d8 points of damage. The 
stone's destruction expels the priest and 
slays him instantly, unless a successful sav- 
ing throw vs. spell is rolled. 

The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds, the 
variable part of the duration rolled secretly 
by the DM. At any time before the duration 
expires, the priest can step out of the stone 
through the stone surface he entered. If the 
duration runs out, or the effect is dispelled 
before the priest exits the stone, then he is 
violently expelled and suffers 4d8 points of 
damage. 

The following spells harm the priest if 
cast upon the stone that he is occupying: 
stone to flesh expels the priest and inflicts 
4d8 points of damage; stone shape causes 
4d4 points of damage, but does not expel the 
priest; transmute rock to mud expels and 
slays him instantly unless he rolls a success- 
ful saving throw vs. spell; passwall expels 
the priest without damage. 


Negative Plane Protection 
(Abjuration) 


Sphere: Protection, Necromantic 
Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell affords the caster or touched 
creature partial protection from undead 
monsters with Negative Material plane con- 
nections (such as shadows, wights, wraiths, 
spectres, or vampires) and certain weapons 
and spells that drain energy levels. The neg- 
ative plane protection spell opens a channel 
to the Positive Material plane, possibly off- 
setting the effect of the negative energy 
attack. A protected creature struck by a 
negative energy attack is allowed a saving 
throw vs. death magic. If successful, the 
energies cancel with a bright flash of light 
and a thunderclap. The protected creature 
suffers only normal hit point damage from 
the attack and does not suffer any drain of 
experience or Strength, regardless of the 
number of levels the attack would have 
drained. An attacking undead creature suf- 
fers 2d6 points of damage from the Positive 
plane energy; a draining wizard or weapon 
receives no damage. 

This protection is proof against only one 
such attack, dissipating immediately wheth- 
er or not the saving throw was successful. If 
the saving throw is failed, the spell recipient 
suffers double the usual physical damage, in 
addition to the loss of experience or 
Strength that normally occurs. The protec- 
tion lasts for one turn per level of the priest 
casting the spell, or until the protected crea- 
ture is struck by a negative energy attack. 
This spell cannot be cast on the Negative 
Material plane. 


Plant Growth (Alteration) 


Sphere: Plant 
Range: 160 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 

The plant growth spell enables the caster 
to choose either of two different uses. The 
first causes normal vegetation to grow, 
entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or 
jungle that creatures must hack or force a 
way through at a movement rate of 10 feet 
per round (or 20 feet per round for larger- 
than-man-sized creatures). Note that the 
area must have brush and trees in it in order 
for this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes, 
creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, 


Priest Spells (3rd Level) 


thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so 
thick and overgrown in the area of effect as 
to form a barrier. The area of effect is a 
square 20 feet on a side per level of experi- 
ence of the caster, in any square or rectangu- 
lar shape that the caster decides upon at the 
time of the spellcasting. Thus an 8th-level 
caster can affect a maximum area of 160’ 
x 160’ square, a 320' X 80’ rectangle, a 
640’ X 40’ rectangle, a 1,280’ X 20’ rec- 
tangle, etc. The spell’s effects persist in the 
area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such 
magical means as a dispel magic spell. 

The second use of the spell affects a one- 
mile square area. The DM secretly makes a 
saving throw (based on the caster’s level) to 
see if the spell takes effect. If successful, the 
spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, 
and hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50% 
({1d4+1] X 10%), given a normal growing 
season. The spell does not prevent disaster 
in the form of floods, drought, fire, or 
insects, although even in these cases the 
plants survive better than expected. This 
effect lasts only for the life cycle of one sea- 
son, the winter “death” marking the end of a 
life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees. In 
many farming communities, this spell is 
normally cast at planting time as part of the 
spring festivals. 


Prayer (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Combat 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 60-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of the prayer spell, the priest 
brings special favor upon himself and his 
party and causes harm to his enemies. 
Those in the area at the instant the spell is 
completed are affected for the duration of 
the spell. When the spell is completed, all 
attack and damage rolls and saving throws 
made by those in the area of effect who are 
friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, 
while those of the priest's enemies suffer —1 
penalties. Once the prayer spell is uttered, 
the priest can do other things, unlike a 
chant, which he must continue to make the 
spell effective. If another priest of the same 
religious persuasion (not merely the same 
alignment) is chanting when a prayer is cast, 
the effects combine to +2 and —2, as long 
as both are in effect at once. 

The priest needs a silver holy symbol, 
prayer beads, or a similar device as the 
material component of this spell. 


212 


Protection From Fire (Abjuration) 


Sphere: Protection, Elemental (Fire) 
Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The effect of a protection from fire spell 
differs according to the recipient of the 
magic—either the caster or some other crea- 
ture. In either case, the spell lasts no longer 
than one turn per caster level. 


* If the spell is cast upon the caster, it confers 
complete invulnerability to normal fires 
(torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and 
to exposure to magical fires such as fiery 
dragon breath, spells such as burning 
hands, fireball, fire seeds, fire storm, flame 
strike, meteor swarm, hell hound or pyro- 
hydra breath, etc., until the spell has 
absorbed 12 points of heat or fire damage 
per level of the caster, at which time the spell 
is negated. 


* If the spell is cast upon another creature, it 
gives invulnerability to normal fire, gives a 
bonus of +4 to saving throw die rolls vs. 
fire attacks, and it reduces damage sus- 
tained from magical fires by 50%. 


The caster’s holy symbol is the material 
component. 


Pyrotechnics (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: 160 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: 10 or 100 times 
a single fire source 
Saving Throw: Special 


A pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing 
fire source to produce either of two effects, 
at the option of the caster. 

* First, it can produce a flashing and fiery 
burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks 
that lasts one round. This effect temporarily 
blinds those creatures in, under, or within 
120 feet of the area that also have an unob- 
structed line of sight to the effect, for 1d4 +1 
rounds unless the creatures roll successful 
saving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a 
volume ten times greater than the original 
fire source. 

* Second, it can cause a thick, writhing 
stream of smoke to arise from the source 
and form a choking cloud that lasts for one 
round per experience level of the caster. This 
covers a roughly hemispherical volume 
from the ground or floor up (or conforming 
to the shape of a confined area) that totally 
obscures vision beyond two feet. The smoke 


Priest Spells (3rd Level) 


fills a volume 100 times that of the fire 
source. 

The spell uses one fire source within the 
area of effect, which is immediately extin- 
guished. An extremely large fire can be used 
as the source, and it is only partially extin- 
guished by the casting. Magical fires are not 
extinguished, although a fire-based creature 
(such as a fire elemental) used as a source 
suffers 1d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of 
damage per caster level. This spell does not 
function under water. 


Remove Curse (Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Protection 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 

Upon casting this spell, the priest is usu- 
ally able to remove a curse on an object, on 
a person, or in the form of some undesired 
sending or evil presence. Note that the re- 
move curse spell does not remove the curse 
from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of ar- 
mor, for example, although the spell typi- 
cally enables the person afflicted with any 
such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain spe- 
cial curses may not be countered by this 
spell, or may be countered only by a caster 
of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th 
level or more can cure lycanthropy with this 
spell by casting it on the animal form. The 
were-creature receives a saving throw vs. 
spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the 
priest must gain a level before attempting 
the remedy on this creature again. 

The reverse of the spell is not permanent; 
the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for 
every experience level of the priest using the 
spell. The curse can have one of the follow- 
ing effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the 
time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 
(the DM randomly determines which abil- 
ity); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's 
attack and saving throw rolls by —4; 25% 
of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to 
drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, 
in the case of creatures not using tools)— 
roll each round. 

It is possible for a priest to devise his own 
curse, and it should be similar in power to 
those given here. Consult your DM. The 
subject of a bestow curse spell must be 
touched. If the victim is touched, a saving 
throw is still applicable; if it is successful, 
the effect is negated. The bestowed curse 
cannot be dispelled. 


Remove Paralysis (Abjuration) 


Sphere: Protection 

Range: 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 1d4 creatures in a 20' cube 
Saving Throw: None 


By the use of this spell, the priest can free 
one or more creatures from the effects of 
any paralyzation or from related magic 
(such as a ghoul touch, or a hold or slow 
spell). If the spell is cast on one creature, the 
paralyzation is negated. If cast on two crea- 
tures, each receives another saving throw 
vs. the effect that afflicts it, with a +4 bo- 
nus. If cast on three or four creatures, each 
receives another saving throw with a +2 
bonus. There must be no physical or magi- 
cal barrier between the caster and the crea- 
tures to be affected, or the spell fails and is 
wasted. 


Snare (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent until triggered 

Casting Time: 3 rounds 

Area of Effect; 2' diameter circle plus */e’ per 
level of the spellcaster 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to make a 
snare that is 90% undetectable without 
magical aid. The snare can be made from 
any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When 
the snare spell is cast upon it, the cord- 
like object blends with its surroundings. 
One end of the snare is tied in a loop that 
contracts around one or more of the limbs 
of any creature stepping inside the circle 
(note that the head of a worm or snake 
could be thus ensnared). 

If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the 
snare can be fastened to it. The magic of the 
spell causes the tree to bend and then 
straighten when the loop is triggered, inflict- 
ing 1d6 points of damage to the creature 
trapped, and lifting it off the ground by the 
trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the 
head/neck triggered the snare). If no such 
sapling or tree is available, the cord-like ob- 
ject tightens upon the member(s), then 
wraps around the entire creature, causing 
no damage, but tightly binding it. Under 
water, the cord coils back upon its anchor 
point. The snare is magical, so for one hour 
it is breakable only by cloud giant or greater 
Strength (23); each hour thereafter, the 
snare material loses magic so as to become 1 
point more breakable per hour—22 after 
two hours, 21 after three, 20 after four— 
until six full hours have elapsed. At that 
time, 18 Strength will break the bonds. Af- 


213 


ter 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of 
the snare lose all magical properties and the 
loop opens, freeing anything it held. The 
snare can be cut with any magical weapon, 
or with any edged weapon wielded with at 
least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for 
example). 

The caster must have a snake skin and a 
piece of sinew from a strong animal to 
weave into the cord-like object from which 
he will make the snare. Only the caster’s 
holy symbol is otherwise needed.

Speak With Dead (Necromancy) 
Sphere: Divination 

Range: 1 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 

Saving Throw: Special 


Upon casting a speak with dead spell, the 
priest is able to ask several questions of a 
dead creature in a set period of time and 
receive answers according to the knowledge 
of that creature. Of course, the priest must 
be able to converse in the language that the 
dead creature once used. The length of time 
the creature has been dead is a factor, since 
only higher level priests can converse with a 
long-dead creature. The number of ques- 
tions that can be answered and the length of 
time in which the questions can be asked 


Priest Spells (3rd Level) 


depend on the level of experience of the 
priest. Even if the casting is successful, such 
creatures are as evasive as possible when 
questioned. The dead tend to give extremely 
brief and limited answers, often cryptic, and 
to take questions literally. Furthermore, 
their knowledge is often limited to what 
they knew in life. 

A dead creature of different alignment or 
of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster’s 
level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A 
dead creature that successfully saves can 
refuse to answer questions, ending the spell. 
At the DM's option, the casting of this spell 
on a given creature might be restricted to 
once per week. 

The priest needs a holy symbol and burn- 
ing incense in order to cast this spell upon 
the body, remains, or a portion thereof, The 
remains are not expended. This spell does 
not function under water.

Spike Growth (Alteration, Enchantment) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3d4 turns + 1/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 10-foot square/level 
Saving Throw: None 


Wherever any type of plant growth of 
moderate size or density is found, this spell 
can be used. The ground-covering vegeta- 
tion or roots and rootlets in the area 
becomes very hard and sharply pointed. In 
effect the ground cover, while appearing to 
be unchanged, acts as if the area were 
strewn with caltrops. In areas of bare 
ground or earthen pits, roots and rootlets 
act in the same way. For each 10 feet of 
movement through the area, the victim suf- 
fers 2d4 points of damage. He must also roll 
a saving throw vs. spell. If this saving throw 
is failed, the victim's movement rate is 
reduced by */3 from its current total (but a 
creature's movement rate can never be less 
than 1). This penalty lasts for 24 hours, after 
which the character's normal movement 
rate is regained. 

Without the use of a spell such as true see- 
ing, similar magical aids, or some other spe- 
cial means of detection (such as detect traps 
or detect snares and pits), an area affected 
by spike growth is absolutely undetectable 


as such until a victim enters the area and suf- 
fers damage. Even then, the creature cannot 
determine the extent of the perilous area 
unless some means of magical detection is 
used. 

The components for this spell are the 
priest's holy symbol and either seven sharp 
thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened 
to a point. 


Starshine (Evocation, Illusion/Phantasm) 


Sphere: Sun 

Range: 10 yd/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 10-foot square/level 
Saving Throw: None 


A starshine spell enables the caster to 
softly illuminate an area as if it were 
exposed to a clear night sky filled with stars. 
Regardless of the height of the open area in 
which the spell is cast, the area immediately 
beneath it is lit by starshine. Vision ranges 
are the same as those for a bright moonlit 
night—movement noted out to 100 yards; 
stationary creatures seen up to 50 yards; 
general identifications made at 30 yards; 
recognition at 10 yards. The spell creates 
shadows and has no effect on infravision. 
The area of effect actually appears to be a 
night sky, but disbelief of the illusion merely 


214 


enables the disbeliever to note that the 
“stars” are actually evoked lights. This spell 
does not function under water. 

The material components are several 
stalks from an amaryllis plant (especially 
Hypoxis) and several holly berries. 


Stone Shape (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Earth) 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 3' cube plus 1’ cube/level 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster can form 
an existing piece of stone into any shape that 
suits his purposes. For example, a stone 
weapon can be made, a special trapdoor 
fashioned, or a crude idol sculpted. By the 
same token, it enables the spellcaster to 
reshape a stone door, perhaps so as to 
escape imprisonment, providing the volume 
of stone involved was within the limits of 
the area of effect. While stone coffers can be 
thus formed, stone doors made, etc., the 
fineness of detail is not great. If the shaping 
has moving parts, there is a 30% chance 
they do not work, 

The material component of this spell is 
soft clay that must be worked into roughly 
the desired shape of the stone object, and 
then touched to the stone when the spell is 
uttered. 


Summon Insects 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


The summon insects spell attracts a cloud 
or swarm of normal insects to attack the 
foes of the caster. Flying insects appear 70% 
of the time, while crawling insects appear 
30% of the time. The exact insects called are 
bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying 
insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching 
beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A 
cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the 
crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast. 
This gathers at a point chosen by the caster, 
within the spell’s range, and attacks any sin- 
gle creature the caster points to. 

The attacked creature sustains 2 points of 
damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee 
or fend off the insects during the time it is 
attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per 
round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, 
the victim fights with a —2 penalty to his 
attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor 


Priest Spells (4th Level) 


Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initia- 
tive roll should be made for the insects to see 
if their damage occurs before the spell is 
cast. If it does, the victim's concentration is 
ruined and the spell is lost. 

The insects disperse and the spell ends if 
the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames. 
Besides being driven off by smoke or hot 
flames, the swarm might possibly be out- 
run, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient 
body of water. If evaded, the summoned 
insects can be sent against another oppo- 
nent, but there will be at least a 1 round 
delay while they leave the former opponent 
and attack the new victim. Crawling insects 
can travel only about 10 feet per round 
(maximum speed over smooth ground) and 
flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The 
caster must concentrate to maintain the 
swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is dis- 
turbed. 

It is possible, in underground situations, 
that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants 
by means of the spell, but the possibility is 
only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This 
spell does not function under water. 

The materials needed for this spell are the 
caster’s holy symbol, a flower petal, and a 
bit of mud or wet clay. 


Tree (Alteration) 
Sphere: Plant 
0 


Range: 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster is able to 
assume the form of a small living tree or 
shrub or that of a large dead tree trunk with 
but a few limbs. Although the closest 
inspection cannot reveal that this plant is 
actually a person, and for all normal tests he 
is, in fact, a tree or shrub, the caster is able 
to observe all that goes on around him just 
as if he were in normal form. The Armor 
Class and hit points of the plant are those of 
the caster. The caster can remove the spell at 
any time, instantly changing from plant to 
his normal form and having full capability 
for any action normally possible (including 
spellcasting). Note that all clothing and gear 
worn or carried with the caster. 

The material components of this spell are 
the priest's holy symbol and a twig from a 
tree. 


Water Breathing (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Water, Air) 
Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 hour/level 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The recipient of a water breathing spell is 
able to breathe under water freely for the 
duration of the spell—i.e., one hour for 
each experience level of the caster. The 
priest can divide the base duration between 
multiple characters. Thus an 8th-level priest 
can confer this ability to two characters for 
four hours, four for two hours, eight for one 
hour, etc., to a minimum of 1/2 hour per 
character. 

The reverse, air breathing, enables water- 
breathing creatures to survive comfortably 
in the atmosphere for an equal duration. 
Note that neither version prevents the recip- 
ient creature from breathing in its natural 
element. 


Water Walk (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Water) 
Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster is able to 
empower one or more creatures to tread 
upon any liquid as if it were firm ground; 
this includes mud, quicksand, oil, running 
water, and snow. The recipient's feet do not 
touch the surface of the liquid, but oval 
depressions of his appropriate foot size and 
two inches deep are left in the mud or snow. 
The recipient's rate of movement remains 
normal, If cast underwater, the recipient is 
borne toward the surface. 

For every level of the caster above the 
minimum required to cast the spell (Sth 
level), he can affect another creature. 

The material components for this spell are 
a piece of cork and the priest's holy symbol. 


Fourth-Level Spells 


Abjure (Abjuration) 
Sphere: Summoning 
Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell can send an extraplanar crea- 
ture back to its own plane of existence. The 
spell fails against entities of demigod status 
or greater, but their servants or minions can 
be abjured. If the creature has a specific 
(proper) name, then that must be known 
and used. Any magic resistance of the sub- 
ject must be overcome, or the spell fails. The 
priest has a 50% chance of success (a roll of 
11 or better on 1d20). The roll is adjusted by 
the difference in level or Hit Dice between 
the caster and the creature being abjured: 
the number needed is decreased if the priest 
has more Hit Dice and increased if the crea- 
ture has more Hit Dice. If the spell is suc- 
cessful, the creature is instantly hurled back 
to its own plane. The affected creature must 
survive a system shock check. If the crea- 
ture does not have a Constitution score, the 
required roll is 70% + 2% /Hit Die or level. 
The caster has no control over where in the 
creature's plane the abjured creature 
arrives. If the attempt fails, the priest must 
gain another level before another attempt 
can be made on that particular creature. 

The spell requires the priest's holy sym- 
bol, holy water, and some material inimical 
to the creature. 


Priest Spells (4th Level) 


Animal Summoning | 
(Conjuration, Summoning) 


Sphere: Animal, Summoning 
Range: 1 mile radius 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster calls up 
to eight animals that have 4 Hit Dice or less, 
of whatever sort the caster names when the 
summoning is made. Only animals within 
range of the caster at the time the spell is cast 
will come. The caster can try three times to 
summon three different types of animals— 
e.g., suppose that wild dogs are first sum- 
moned to no avail, then hawks are 
unsuccessfully called, and finally the caster 
calls for wild horses that may or may not be 
within summoning range. Your DM must 
determine the chance of a summoned ani- 
mal type being within the range of the spell. 
The animals summoned aid the caster by 
whatever means they possess, staying until 
a fight is over, a specific mission is finished, 
the caster is safe, he sends them away, etc. 
Only normal or giant animals can be sum- 
moned; fantastic animals or monsters can- 
not be summoned by this spell (no 
chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, 
etc.). 


Call Woodland Beings 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Summoning 
Range: 100 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


By means of this spell, the caster is able to 
summon certain woodland creatures to his 
location. Naturally, this spell works only 
outdoors, but not necessarily only in wood- 
ed areas. The caster begins the incantation 
and continues uninterrupted until some 
called creature appears or two turns have 
elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic 
gesturing are easy, so this is not particularly 
exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type 


of the following sorts of beings can be sum- 
moned by the spell. They come only if they 
are within the range of the call. 

The caster can call three times, for a dif- 
ferent type each time. Once a call is success- 
ful, no other type can be called without 
another casting of the spell. (Your DM will 
consult his outdoor map or base the proba- 
bility of any such creature being within spell 
range upon the nature of the area the caster 
is in at the time of spellcasting.) 

The creature(s) called by the spell are 
entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a 
—4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any 
woodland beings answering the call are 
favorably disposed to the spellcaster and 
give whatever aid they are capable of. How- 
ever, if the caller or members of the caller's 
party are of evil alignment, the creatures are 
entitled to another saving throw vs. spell 
(this time with a +4 bonus) when they come 
within 10 yards of the caster or another evil 
character with him. These beings immedi- 
ately seek to escape if their saving throws 
are successful. In any event, if the caster 
requests that the summoned creatures 
engage in combat on his behalf, they are 
required to roll a loyalty reaction check 
based on the caster’s Charisma and what- 
ever dealings he has had with them. 

This spell works with respect to neutral or 
good woodland creatures, as determined by 
the DM. Thus the DM can freely add to or 
alter the list as he sees fit. 

If the caster personally knows a certain 
individual woodland being, that being can 
be summoned at double the normal range. If 
this is done, then no other woodland crea- 
tures are affected. 

The material components of this spell are 
a pine cone and eight holly berries. 

If a percentage chance is given, druids 
and other nature-based priests add 1% per 
caster level. These chances can be used if no 
other campaign information on the area is 
available.

Cloak of Bravery 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Charm 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The cloak of bravery spell can be cast 
upon any willing creature. The protected 
individual gains a bonus to his saving throw 
against any form of fear encountered (but 
not awe—an ability of some Lesser and 
Greater Powers). When cast, the spell can 
affect one to four creatures (caster’s choice). 
If only one is affected, the saving throw 
bonus is +4. If two are affected, the bonus 
is +3, and so forth, until four creatures are 
protected by a +1 bonus. The magic of the 
cloak of bravery spell works only once and 
then the spell ends, whether or not the crea- 
ture’s saving throw is successful. The spell 
ends after eight hours if no saving throw is 
required before then. 

The reverse of this spell, cloak of fear, 
empowers a single creature touched to radi- 
ate a personal aura of fear, at will, out to a 
three-foot radius. All other characters and 
creatures within this aura must roll success- 
ful saving throws vs. spell or run away in 
panic for 2d8 rounds. Affected individuals 
may or may not drop items, at the DM's 
option. 

The spell has no effect upon undead of 
any sort. The effect can be used but once, 
and the spell expires after eight hours if not 
brought down earlier. Members of the recip- 
ient's party are not immune to the effects of 
the spell. 

The material component for the cloak of 
bravery spell is the feather of an eagle or 
hawk. The reverse requires the tail feathers 
of a vulture or chicken. 


Control Temperature, 10’ Radius 
(Alteration) 


Sphere: Weather 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 4 turns + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the temperature 
surrounding the caster can be altered by 10 
degrees Fahrenheit, either upward or down- 
ward, per level of experience of the spell- 
caster. Thus, a 10th-level caster could raise 
or lower the surrounding temperature from 
1 to 100 degrees. The spell can be used to 
ensure the comfort of the caster and those 
with him in extreme weather conditions. 


Priest Spells (4th Level) 


The party could stand about in shirt sleeves 
during the worst blizzard (although it would 
be raining on them) or make ice for their 
drinks during a scorching heat wave. 

The spell also provides protection from 
intense normal and magical attacks. If the 
extreme of temperature is beyond what 
could be affected by the spell (a searing blast 
of a fireball or the icy chill of a white 
dragon), the spell reduces the damage 
caused by 5 points for every level of the 
caster. Normal saving throws are still 
allowed, and the reduction is taken after the 
saving throw is made or failed. Once struck 
by such an attack, the spell immediately col- 
lapses. 

The material component for this spell is a 
strip of willow bark (to lower temperatures) 
or raspberry leaves (to raise temperatures). 


Cure Serious Wounds (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Healing 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell is a more potent version of the 
cure light wounds spell. When laying his 
hand upon a creature, the priest heals 
2d8+1 points of wound or other injury 
damage to the creature's body. This healing 
cannot affect noncorporeal, nonliving, or 
extraplanar creatures. 

Cause serious wounds, the reverse of the 
spell, operates similarly to the cause light 
wounds spell, the victim having to be touch- 
ed first. If the touch is successful, 2d8+1 
points of damage are inflicted. 


Detect Lie (Divination) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Divination 
Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


A priest who casts this spell is immedi- 
ately able to determine if the subject crea- 
ture deliberately and knowingly speaks a 
lie. It does not reveal the truth, uncover 
unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily 
reveal evasions. The subject receives a sav- 
ing throw vs. spell, which is adjusted only 
by the Wisdom of the caster—e.g., if the 
caster has a Wisdom of 18, the subject's sav- 
ing throw roll is reduced by 4 (see Table 5). 

The material component for the detect lie 
spell is one gp worth of gold dust. 


The spell’s reverse, undetectable lie, pre- 
vents the magical detection of lies spoken by 
the creature for 24 hours. 

The reverse requires brass dust as its 
material component. 


Divination (Divination) 


Sphere: Divination 
Range: 0 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


A divination spell is used to garner a use- 
ful piece of advice concerning a specific 
goal, event, or activity that will occur with- 
in a one-week period. This can be as simple 
as a short phrase, or it might take the form 
of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the 
augury spell, this gives a specific piece of 
advice. For example, if the question is “Will 
we do well if we venture to the third level?” 
and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a 
shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the 
level (the DM estimates the party could beat 
the troll after a hard fight) the divination 
response might be: “Ready oil and open 
flame light your way to wealth.” In all cases, 
the DM controls what information is 
received and whether additional divinations 
will supply additional information. Note 
that if the information is not acted upon, the 
conditions probably change so that the 
information is no longer useful (in the exam- 
ple, the troll might move away and take the 
treasure with it). 

The base chance for a correct divination 
is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of 
the priest casting the spell. The DM makes 
adjustments to this base chance considering 
the actions being divined (if, for example, 
unusual precautions against the spell have 
been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the cast- 
er knows the spell failed, unless specific 
magic yielding false information is at work. 

The material components of the divina- 
tion spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, 
and the holy symbol of the priest. If an 
unusually important divination is attempt- 
ed, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems, 
jewelry, or magical items may be required. 


Free Action (Abjuration, Enchantment) 


Sphere: Charm 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the creature touched to 
move and attack normally for the duration 
of the spell, even under the influence of 


217 


magic that impedes movement (such as web 
or slow spells) or while under water. It even 
negates or prevents the effects of paralysis 
and hold spells, Under water, the individual 
moves at normal (surface) speed and inflicts 
full damage, even with such cutting weap- 
ons as axes and swords and with such 
smashing weapons as flails, hammers, and 
maces, provided that the weapon is wielded 
in the hand rather than hurled. The free 
action spell does not, however, allow water 
breathing without further appropriate mag- 
ic. 

The material component is a leather 
thong, bound around the arm or similar 
appendage, which disintegrates when the 


spell expires. 


Giant Insect (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: 20 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 1 to 6 insects 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the priest can turn 
one or more norma)-sized insects into larger 
forms resembling the giant insects described 
in the Monstrous Compendium. Only one 
type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e., 
a single casting cannot affect both an ant 
and a fly) and all insects affected must be 
grown to the same size. The number of 
insects and the size to which they can be 
grown depend upon the priest's level: 


Priest's Insect Maximum 

Level Hit Dice Total HD 
7-9 3 9 
10-12 4 12 
13+ 6 15 


For example, an 8th-level priest can grow 
three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2 
Hit Dice, or nine insects to 1 hit die. Flying 
insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a 
rider of human size (assume that such can 
carry 80 pounds per Hit Die). 

If the casting is interrupted for any rea- 
son, or if the insects are currently subject to 
any other magical effect (including this 
one), the insects die and the spell is ruined. 
The DM decides how many normal insects 
of what type are available; this is often a 
greater limitation on the spell than the limits 
above. 

If the insect created by this spell matches 
an existing monster description, use the 
monster description. Otherwise, unless the 
DM creates a special description, the giant 
form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 
4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of 
damage per Hit Die. 


Example: A 14th-level priest uses the gi- 
ant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that 
is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides 
the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 
points of damage. 

Note that the spell works only on actual 
insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other 
types of small creatures are not affected. 
Any giant insects created by this spell do not 
attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's 
control of such creatures is limited to simple 
commands (“attack,” “defend,” “guard;” and 
so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature 
when it appears or guard against a particu- 
lar occurrence are too complex. Unless com- 
manded to do otherwise, the giant insects 
attempt to attack whoever or whatever is 
near them. 

The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, re- 
duces any giant insect to normal insect size. 
The number of Hit Dice affected by the 
priest is subtracted from the number of Hit 
Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced 
to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial 
shrinking is ignored; an insect is either 
shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level 
priest attacked by giant ants could shrink 
three warrior ants or four worker ants to 
normal insect size with no saving throw. 
This spell has no effect on intelligent insect- 
like creatures. 

The priest must use his holy symbol for 
either version of the spell. 


Hallucinatory Forest 
(Ilusion/Phantasm) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: 80 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 40-foot square/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, a hallucinatory 
forest comes into existence. The illusionary 
forest appears to be perfectly natural and is 
indistinguishable from a real forest. Priests 
attuned to the woodlands—as well as such 
creatures as centaurs, dryads, green drag- 
ons, nymphs, satyrs, and treants— 
recognize the forest for what it is. All other 
creatures believe it is there, and movement 
and order of march are affected accordingly. 
Touching the illusory growth neither affects 
the magic nor reveals its nature. The hallu- 
cinatory forest remains until it is magically 
dispelled by a reverse of the spell or a dispel 
magic spell. The area shape is either roughly 
rectangular or square, in general, and at 
least 40 feet deep, in whatever location the 
caster desires. The forest can be of less than 
maximum area if the caster wishes. One of 
its edges can appear up to 80 yards away 
from the caster. 


Priest Spells (4th Level) 


Hold Plant (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: 80 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The hold plant spell affects vegetable 
matter as follows: 1) it causes ambulatory 
vegetation to cease moving; 2) it prevents 
vegetable matter from entwining, grasping, 
closing, or growing; 3) it prevents vegetable 
matter from making any sound or move- 
ment that is not caused by wind. The spell 
effects apply to all forms of vegetation, in- 
cluding parasitic and fungoid types, and 
those magically animated or otherwise mag- 
ically empowered. It affects such monsters 
as green slime, molds of any sort, shambling 
mounds, shriekers, treants, etc. The dura- 
tion of a hold plant spell is one round per 
level of experience of the caster. It affects 
1d4 plants in a 40' x 40’ area—or a square 
four to 16 yards on a side of small ground 
growth such as grass or mold. If but one 
plant (or four yards square) is chosen as the 
target for the spell by the caster, the saving 
throw of the plant (or area of plant growth) 
is made with a —4 penalty to the die roll; if 
two plants (or eight yards square) are the 
target, saving throws suffer a —2 penalty; if 
three plants (or 12 yards square) are the tar- 
get, saving throws suffer a —1 penalty; and 
if the maximum of four plants (or 16 yards 
square) are the target, saving throws are un- 
modified. 


Imbue With Spell Ability 
(Enchantment) 


Sphere: Charm 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Person touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By the use of this spell, the priest can 
transfer a limited number and selection of 
his currently memorized spells, and the abil- 
ity to cast them, to another person. Only 
non-spellcasters (including rangers under 
8th level and paladins under 9th level) can 
receive this bestowal; the imbue with spell 
ability enchantment does not function for 
those belonging to spellcasting classes, for 
unintelligent monsters, nor for any individ- 
ual with less than 1 full Hit Die. In addition, 
the person thus imbued must have a Wis- 
dom score of 9 or higher. Only priest spells 
of an informational or defensive nature or a 
cure light wounds spell can be transferred. 
Transferring any other spell type negates the 


218 


entire attempt, including any allowable 
spells that were chosen. Higher level per- 
sons can receive more than one spell at the 
priest's option: 


Level of Recipient Spells Imbued 
1 One 1st-level spell 
3 Two 1st-level spells 
5+ Two Ist- and one 
2nd-level spells 


The transferred spell’s variable character- 
istics (range, duration, area of effect, etc.) 
function according to the level of the priest 
originally imbuing the spell. 

A priest who casts imbue with spell abil- 
ity upon another character loses the number 
of 1st- and 2nd-level spells he has imbued 
until the recipient uses the transferred spells 
or is slain. For example, a 7th-level priest 
with five 1st- and four 2nd-level spells im- 
bues a 10th-level fighter with a cure light 
wounds spell and a slow poison spell. The 
cleric now can have only four Ist-level 
spells memorized until the cure is cast and 
only three 2nd-level spells until the slow 
poison is cast, or until the fighter is killed. In 
the meantime, the priest remains responsi- 
ble to his ethos for the use to which the spell 
is put. 

The material components for this spell are 
the priest's holy symbol, plus some minor 
item from the recipient that is symbolic of 
his profession (a lockpick for a thief, etc.). 
This item, and any material component for 
the imbued spell, is consumed when the im- 
bue with spell ability spell is cast. 


Lower Water (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Water) 
Range: 120 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The lower water spell causes water or 
similar fluid in the area of effect to sink 
away to a minimum depth of one inch. The 
depth can be lowered by up to two feet for 
every experience level of the priest. The wa- 
ter is lowered within a square area whose 
sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus, 
an 8th-level priest affects a volume up to 16’ 
x 80’ X 80’, a 9th-level caster affects a vol- 
ume up to 18’ X 90’ X 90’, and so on. In 
extremely large and deep bodies of water, 
such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirl- 
pool that sweeps ships and similar craft 
downward, putting them at risk and render- 
ing them unable to leave by normal move- 
ment for the duration of the spell. When 
cast on water elementals and other water- 
based creatures, this spell acts as a slow 


Priest Spells (4th Level) 


spell: the creature moves at half speed and 
makes half its usual number of attacks each 
round. The spell has no effect on other crea- 
tures. 

Its reverse, raise water, causes water or 
similar fluids to return to their highest natu- 
ral level; spring flood, high tide, etc. This 
can make fords impassable, float grounded 
ships, and may even sweep away bridges at 
the DM's option. It negates lower water and 
vice versa. 

The material components of this spell are 
the priest's holy (or unholy) symbol and a 
pinch of dust. 


Neutralize Poison (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Healing 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Creature touched or 1 cubic 
foot of substance/2 levels 

Saving Throw: None 


By means of a neutralize poison spell, the 
priest detoxifies any sort of venom in the 
creature or substance touched. Note that an 
opponent, such as a poisonous reptile or 
snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an 
opponent) unwilling to be so touched 
requires the priest to roll a successful attack 
in combat. This spell can prevent death in a 
poisoned creature if cast before death 
occurs. The effects of the spell are perma- 
nent only with respect to poison existing in 
the touched creature at the time of the 
touch, thus creatures (and objects) that gen- 
erate new poison are not permanently 
detoxified. 

The reversed spell, poison, likewise 
requires an attack roll that succeeds, and the 
victim is allowed a saving throw vs. poison. 
If the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is 
incapacitated and dies in one turn unless the 
poison is magically neutralized or slowed. 


Plant Door (Alteration) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The plant door spell opens a magical portal 
or passageway through trees, undergrowth, 
thickets, or any similar growth—even 
growth of a magical nature. The plant door 
is open to the caster who cast the spell, cast- 
ers of a higher level, or dryads; others must 
be shown the location of the door. The door 
even enables the caster to enter a solid tree 


trunk and remain hidden there until the 
spell ends. The spell also enables the passage 
or hiding of any man-sized or smaller crea- 
ture; hiding is subject to space consider- 
ations. If the tree is cut down or burned, 
those within must leave before the tree falls 
or is consumed, or else they are killed also. 
The duration of the spell is one turn per level 
of experience of the caster. If the caster opts 
to stay within an oak, the spell lasts nine 
times longer, if in an ash tree, it lasts three 
times longer than normal. The path created 
by the spell is up to four feet wide, eight feet 
high, and 12 feet long per level of experience 
of the caster. This spell does not function on 
plant-based monsters—e.g., shambling 
mounds, molds, slimes, treants, etc. 

The material components for this spell are 
a piece of charcoal and the caster’s holy 
symbol. 


Produce Fire (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: 40 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 12-foot square 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster causes a 
common fire of up to 12 feet per side in area. 
Though it lasts but a single round, unless it 
ignites additional flammable material, the 
fire produced by the spell inflicts 1d4 points 
of damage plus 1 point per caster level (1d4 
+ 1/level) upon creatures within its area. It 
ignites combustible materials, such as cloth, 
oil, paper, parchment, wood, and the like, 
so as to cause continued burning. 

The reverse, quench fire, extinguishes 
any normal fire (coals, oil, tallow, wax, 
wood, etc.) within the area of effect. 

The material component for either ver- 
sion is a paste of sulfur and wax, formed 
into a ball and thrown at the target. 


Protection From Evil, 10’ Radius 
(Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Protection 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere 
Saving Throw: None 


The globe of protection of this spell is 
identical in all respects to that of a protec- 
tion from evil spell, except that it encom- 
passes a much larger area and its duration is 
greater. The effect is centered on and moves 
with the creature touched. Any protected 


219 


creature within the circle will break the 
warding against enchanted/summoned 
monsters if he attacks those monsters. A 
creature unable to fit completely into the 
area of effect (for example, a 21-foot-tall 
titan) remains partially exposed and subject 
to whatever penalties the DM decides. If 
such a creature is the recipient of the spell, 
the spell acts as a normal protection from 
evil spell for that creature only. 

The reverse, protection from good, 10' 
radius, wards against good creatures. 

To complete this spell, the priest must 
trace a circle 20 feet in diameter using holy 
(or unholy) water and incense (or smolder- 
ing dung), according to the protection from 
evil spell. 


Protection From Lightning 
(Abjuration) 


Sphere: Protection, Weather 
Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The effect of a protection from lightning 
spell changes depending on who is the recip- 
ient of the magic—the caster or some other 
creature. In either case, the spell lasts no 
longer than one turn per caster level. 

* If the spell is cast upon the caster, it 
confers complete invulnerability to electri- 
cal attack such as dragon breath, or magical 
lightning such as lightning bolt, shocking 
grasp, storm giant, will ‘o wisp, etc., until 
the spell has absorbed 10 points of electrical 
damage per level of the caster, at which time 
the spell is negated. 

* If the spell is cast upon another crea- 
ture, it gives a bonus of +4 to the die roll for 
saving throws made vs. electrical attacks, 
and it reduces the damage sustained from 
such attacks by 50%. 


The caster's holy symbol is the material 
component. 


Reflecting Pool (Divination) 


Sphere: Divination 
Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 hours 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to cause a 
pool of normal water found in a natural set- 
ting to act as a scrying device. The pool can 
be of no greater diameter than two feet per 
level of the caster. The effect is to create a 
scrying device similar to a crystal ball. The 


scrying can extend only to those planes of 
existence that are coexistent with or border 
on the Prime Material plane—the inner 
planes (including the para-elemental planes, 
plane of Shadow, etc.). General notes on 
scrying, detection by the subject, and penal- 
ties for attempting to scry beyond the cast- 
er’s own plane are given in the DMG, as well 
as a description of the crystal ball item. 

The following spells can be cast through a 
reflecting pool, with a 5% per level chance 
for operating correctly: detect magic, detect 
snares and pits, detect poison. Each addi- 
tional detection attempt requires a round of 
concentration, regardless of success. Infra- 
vision, if available, operates normally 
through the reflecting pool. 

The image is nearly always hazy enough 
to prevent the reading of script of any type. 

The material component is the oil extract- 
ed from such nuts as the hickory and the 
walnut, refined, and dropped in three mea- 
sures upon the surface of the pool. (A mea- 
sure need be no more than a single ounce of 
oil.) 

At the DM‘s option, the casting of this 
spell may be limited to once per day. 


Repel Insects (Abjuration, Alteration) 


Sphere: Animal, Protection 
Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the priest creates 
an invisible barrier to all sorts of insects, 
and normal insects do not approach within 
10 feet of the caster while the spell is in 
effect. Giant insects with Hit Dice less than 
1/3 of the caster's experience level are also 
repelled (e.g., 2 Hit Dice for 7th- to 9th-level 
casters, 3 Hit Dice at 10th through 12th 
level, etc.). Insects with more Hit Dice can 
enter the protected area if the insect is espe- 
cially aggressive and, in addition, rolls a 
successful saving throw vs. spell. Those that 
do sustain 1d6 points of damage from pass- 
ing of the magical barrier. Note that the 
spell does not in any way affect arachnids, 
myriapods, and similar creatures—it affects 
only true insects. 

The material components of the repel 
insects spell include any one of the follow- 
ing: several crushed marigold flowers, a 
whole crushed leek, seven crushed stinging 
nettle leaves, or a small lump of resin from a 
camphor tree. 


Priest Spells (4th Level) 


Speak With Plants (Alteration) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


When cast, a speak with plants spell 
enables the priest to converse, in very rudi- 
mentary terms, with all sorts of living vege- 
tables (including fungi, molds, and 
plant-like monsters, such as shambling 
mounds) and to exercise limited control 
over normal plants (i.e., not monsters or 
plant-like creatures), Thus, the caster can 
question plants as to whether or not crea- 
tures have passed through them, cause 
thickets to part to enable easy passage, 
require vines to entangle pursuers, and com- 
mand similar services. The spell does not 
enable plants to uproot themselves and 
move about, but any movements within the 
plants’ normal capabilities are possible. 
Creatures entangled by the 1st-level spell of 
that name can be released. The power of the 
spell lasts for one round for each experience 
level of the casting priest. All vegetation 
within the area of effect is affected by the 
spell. 
The material components for this spell are 
a drop of water, a pinch of dung, and a 
flame. 


Spell Immunity (Abjuration) 


Sphere: Protection 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the priest renders a 
creature touched immune to the effects of a 
specified spell of 4th level or lower. It pro- 
tects against spells, spell-like effects of magi- 
cal items, and innate spell-like abilities of 
creatures. It does not protect against breath 
weapons or gaze attacks of any type. The 
spell has additional limitations, First, the 
caster must have directly experienced the 
effect of the spell specified. For example, if 
the caster has been attacked by a fireball 
spell at some time, then he can use spell 
immunity to provide protection from a fire- 
ball. Second, the spell cannot affect a crea- 
ture already magically protected by a 
potion, protective spell, ring, or other 
device. Third, only a particular spell can be 
protected against, not a certain sphere of 
spells or a group of spells that are similar in 
effect; thus, a creature given immunity to 
the lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a 
shocking grasp spell. 


220 


The material component for spell immu- 
nity is the same as that for the spell to be 
protected against. 


Sticks to Snakes (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: 1d4 sticks + 1 stick/levelina 
10-foot cube 

Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster can 
change 1d4 sticks, plus one stick per experi- 
ence level, into snakes; thus a 9th-level 
priest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal 
number of snakes. These snakes attack as 
commanded by the priest. There must, of 
course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood 
(such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into 
snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a 
staff. Sticks held by creatures are allowed a 
saving throw equal to that of the possessor 
(i.e., a spear held by an orc must fail the 
orc’s saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical 
items, such as staves and enchanted spears, 
are not affected by the spell. Only sticks 
within the area of effect are changed. The 
type of snake created varies, but a typical 
specimen has 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 6, a 
movement rate of 9, and either constricts 
for 1d4+1 points of damage per round or 
bites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The 
chance of a snake thus changed being ven- 
omous is 5% per caster level, if the spellcast- 
er desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a 
maximum 55% chance that any snake cre- 
ated by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts 
for two rounds for each experience level of 
the spellcaster. 

The material components of the spell are a 
small piece of bark and several snake scales. 

The reverse changes normal-sized snakes 
to sticks for the same duration, or it negates 
the sticks to snakes spell according to the 
level of the priest countering the spell (e.g., 
a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell 
can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks). 


Tongues (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Divination 
:0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn 

Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: The caster 

Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to speak and 
understand additional languages, whether 
they are racial tongues or regional dialects, 


Priest Spells (Sth Level) 


but not communications of animals or 
mindless creatures. When the spell is cast, 
the spellcaster selects the language or lan- 
guages to be understood. The spell then em- 
powers the caster with the ability to speak 
and understand the language desired with 
perfect fluency and accent. The spell enables 
the priest to be understood by all speakers 
of that language within hearing distance, 
usually 60 feet. This spell does not predis- 
pose the subject toward the caster in any 
way. The priest can speak one additional 
tongue for every three levels of experience. 

The reverse of the spell cancels the effect 
of the tongues spell or confuses verbal com- 
munication of any sort within the area of ef- 
fect. 


Fifth-Level Spells 


Air Walk (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Air) 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables a creature, which can 
be as large as the largest giant, to tread upon 
air just as if it were solid ground. Moving 
upward is similar to walking up a hill; a 
maximum upward angle of 45 degrees is 
possible at one-half the creature's move- 
ment rate. Likewise, a maximum downward 


angle of 45 degrees at the normal movement 
rate is possible. An air-walking creature is 
always in control of its movement rate, save 
when a wind is blowing. In this case the 
creature gains or loses 10 feet of movement 
for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. 
The creature may, at the DM's option, be 
subject to additional penalties, loss of con- 
trol, and possible damage in exceptionally 
strong or turbulent winds. 

The spell can be placed upon a trained 
mount, so it can be ridden through the air. 
Of course, a mount not accustomed to such 
movement would certainly need careful and 
lengthy training, the details of which are up 
to the DM. 

The material components for the spell are 
the priest's holy symbol and a bit of thistle- 
down. 


Animal Growth (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Animal 

Range: 80 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Up to 8 animals in a 
20-foot-square area 

Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the caster causes 
all animals, up to a maximum of eight, 
within a 20-foot-square area to grow to 
twice their normal size. The effects of this 
growth are doubled Hit Dice (with resultant 
improvement in attack potential), doubled 
hit points (except hit points added to Hit 
Dice), and doubled damage in combat. 
Movement and AC are not affected. The 
spell lasts for two rounds for each level of 
the caster. The spell is particularly useful in 
conjunction with a charm person or mam- 
mal spell. 

The reverse reduces animal size by one- 
half, and likewise reduces Hit Dice, hit 
points, attack damage, etc. 

The material component for this spell and 
its reverse is the caster’s holy symbol and a 
scrap of food. 


Animal Summoning Il 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Animal, Summoning 
Range: 60 yards/level 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster calls up 
to six animals that have 8 Hit Dice or less, or 
12 animals of 4 Hit Dice or less, of whatever 
sort the caster names. Only animals within 


221 


range of the caster at the time the spell is cast 
will come. The caster can try three times to 
summon three different types of animals— 
suppose that wild dogs are first summoned 
to no avail, then hawks are unsuccessfully 
called, and finally the caster calls for wild 
horses that may or may not be within sum- 
moning range. Your DM will determine the 
chance of a summoned animal type being 
within range of the spell. The animals sum- 
moned aid the caster by whatever means 
they possess, staying until a fight is over, a 
specific mission is finished, the caster is safe, 
he sends them away, etc. Only normal or gi- 
ant animals can be summoned; fantastic an- 
imals or monsters cannot be summoned by 
this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, 
manticores, etc.). 


Anti-Plant Shell (Abjuration) 


Sphere: Plant, Protection 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: 15’ diameter hemisphere 
Saving Throw: None 


The anti-plant shell spell creates an invisi- 
ble, mobile barrier that keeps out all crea- 
tures or missiles of living vegetable 
material. Thus, the caster (and any crea- 
tures within the shell) is protected from at- 
tacking plants or vegetable creatures such as 
shambling mounds or treants. Any attempt 
to force the barrier against such creatures 
shatters the barrier immediately. The spell 
lasts for one turn for each experience level of 
the caster. 


Atonement (Abjuration) 


Sphere: All 

Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell is used by the priest to remove 
the burden of unwilling or unknown deeds 
from the person who is the subject of the 
atonement. The spell removes the effects of 
magical alignment change as well. The per- 
son seeking the atonement spell must either 
be truly repentant or not have been in com- 
mand of his own will when the acts to be 
atoned for were committed. Your DM will 
judge this spell in this regard, noting any 
past instances of its use upon the person. 
Deliberate misdeeds and acts of knowing 
and willful nature cannot be atoned for with 
this spell (see the quest spell). A character 
who refuses to accept an atonement is auto- 
matically considered to have committed a 


Priest Spells (5th Level) 


The priest needs his religious symbol, 
prayer beads or wheel or book, and burning 
incense. 


Commune (Divination) 
Sphere: Divination 
:0 


Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By use of a commune spell, the priest is 
able to contact his divinity—or agents 
thereof—and request information in the 
form of questions that can be answered by a 
simple “yes” or “no.” The priest is allowed 
one such question for every experience level 
he has attained. The answers given are cor- 
rect within the limits of the entity's knowl- 
edge (“I don’t know” is a legitimate answer, 
as powerful outer planar beings are not nec- 
essarily omniscient). Optionally, the DM 
may give a single short answer, of five 
words or less. The spell will, at best, pro- 
vide information to aid character decisions. 
Entities communed with structure their an- 
swers to further their own purposes. It is 
probable that the DM will limit the use of 
commune spells to one per adventure, one 
per week, or even one per month, for the 
greater powers dislike frequent interrup- 
tions. Likewise, if the caster lags, discusses 
the answers, or goes off to do anything else, 
the spell immediately ends. 

The material components necessary to a 
commune spell are the priest's religious sym- 
bol, holy (unholy) water, and incense. If a 
particularly potent commune is needed, a 
sacrifice proportionate with the difficulty of 
obtaining the information is required, and if 
the offering is insufficient, only partial or no 
information is gained. 


Commune With Nature (Divination) 
Sphere: Divination 


Range: 0 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to become 
one with nature in the area, thus being em- 
powered with knowledge of the surround- 
ing territory. For each level of experience of 
the caster, he can “know” one fact: the 
ground ahead, left or right; the plants 
ahead, left or right; the minerals ahead, left 
or right; the water courses/bodies of water 
ahead, left or right; the people dwelling 
ahead, left or right; the general animal pop- 
ulation, left or right; the presence of wood- 
land creatures, left or right; etc. The 


presence of powerful unnatural creatures 
can also be detected, as can the general state 
of the natural setting. The spell is most ef- 
fective in outdoor settings, operating in a 
radius of one-half mile for each level of the 
caster. In natural underground settings— 
caves, caverns, etc.—the range is limited to 
10 yards per caster level. In constructed set- 
tings (dungeons and towns), the spell will 
not function. The DM may limit the casting 
of this spell to once per month. 


Control Winds (Alteration) 


Sphere: Weather 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: 40-foot/level radius 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of a control winds spell, the 
caster is able to alter wind force in the area 
of effect. For every three levels of experi- 
ence, the caster can increase or decrease 
wind force by one level of strength. Wind 
strengths are as follows: 


Wind Force Miles Per Hour 
Light Breeze 2-7 
Moderate Breeze 8-18 
Strong Breeze 19-31 
Gale 32-54 
Storm 55-72 
Hurricane 73-176 


Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive 
small flying creatures (those eagle-sized and 
under) from the skies, severely affect missile 
accuracy, and make sailing difficult. Winds 
in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even 
man-sized flying creatures from the skies 
and cause minor ship damage. Winds in ex- 
cess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying 
creatures from the skies, uproot trees of 
small size, knock down wooden structures, 
tear off roofs, etc., and endanger ships. 
Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of 
hurricane force. 

An “eye” of 40-foot radius, in which the 
wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note 
that while the spell can be used in under- 
ground places, the eye shrinks one foot for 
every foot of confinement, if the spell is cast 
in an area smaller than the area of effect. 
(For example, if the area of effect is a 360- 
foot radius, and the space only allows a 350- 
foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 
30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in ra- 
dius would eliminate the eye and subject the 
spellcaster to the effects of the wind.) 

Once the spell is cast, the wind force in- 
creases (or decreases) by 3 miles per hour 
per round until the maximum (or minimum) 
speed is attained. The caster, with one 
round of complete concentration, can stabi- 
lize the wind at its current strength, or set it 


222 


to increase or decrease, although the rate of 
the change cannot be altered. The spell re- 
mains in force for one turn for each level of 
experience of the caster. When the spell is 
exhausted, the force of the wind wanes (or 
waxes) at the same rate, until it reaches the 
level it was at before the spell took effect. 
Another caster can use a control winds spell 
to counter the effects of a like spell up to the 
limits of his own ability. 


Cure Critical Wounds (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Healing 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The cure critical wounds spell is a very 
potent version of the cure light wounds 
spell. The priest lays his hand upon a crea- 
ture and heals 3d8+3 points of damage 
from wounds or other damage. The spell 
does not affect creatures without corporeal 
bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those 
not living. 

The reversed spell, cause critical wounds, 
operates in the same fashion as other cause 
wounds spells, requiring a successful touch 
to inflict the 3d8+3 points of damage. 
Caused wounds heal via the same methods 
as do wounds of other sorts. 


Dispel Evil (Abjuration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Protection, Summoning 
Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The priest using this spell causes a sum- 
moned creature of evil nature, an evil crea- 
ture from another plane, or a creature 
summoned by an evil caster, to return to its 
own plane or place when the caster success- 
fully strikes it in melee combat. (Examples 
of such creatures are aerial servants, djinn, 
efreet, elementals, and invisible stalkers.) 
An evil enchantment (such as a charm spell 
cast by an evil creature) that is subject to a 
normal dispel magic spell can be automati- 
cally dispelled by the dispel evil spell. Note 
that this spell lasts for a maximum of one 
round for each experience level of the caster, 
or until expended. While the spell is in ef- 
fect, all creatures that could be affected by it 
attack with a —7 penalty to their attack 
rolls when engaging the spellcaster. 


Priest Spells (5th Level) 


The reverse of the spell, dispel good, 
functions against summoned or enchanted 
creatures of good alignment or creatures 
that have been sent to aid the cause of good. 

The material components for this spell are 
the priest's religious object and holy (or un- 
holy) water. 


Flame Strike (Evocation) 


Sphere: Combat 
Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 8 
Area of Effect: 5-foot radius 
by 30-foot-high column 
Saving Throw: !/2 


When the priest calls down a flame strike 
spell, a vertical column of fire roars down- 
ward in the exact location called for by the 
caster. Any creature within the area of effect 
of a flame strike must roll a saving throw vs. 
spell. Failure means the creature sustains 
6d8 points of damage; otherwise, the dam- 
age is halved. 

The material component of this spell is a 
pinch of sulphur. 


Insect Plague (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Combat 

Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 2 rounds/level 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 180' diameter, 60’ high cloud 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast by the priest, a 
horde of creeping, hopping, and flying in- 
sects gather and swarm in a thick cloud. (In 
an environment free of normal insects, the 
spell fails.) The insects obscure vision, limit- 
ing it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the 
cloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect 
plague sustain 1 point of damage for each 
round they remain within, due to the bites 
and stings of the insects, regardless of Ar- 
mor Class. Invisibility is no protection. All 
creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will auto- 
matically move at their fastest possible 
speed in a random direction until they are 
more than 240 yards away from the insects. 
Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must 
check morale; failure means they run as de- 
scribed above. 

Heavy smoke drives off insects within its 
bounds. Fire also drives insects away; a wall 
of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently 
cast insect plague outside its confines, but a 
fireball simply clears insects from its blast 
area for one round. A single torch is ineffec- 
tive against this vast horde of insects. Light- 
ning, cold, or ice are likewise ineffective, 
while a strong wind that covers the entire 
plague area disperses the insects and ends 


the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for 
each level of the caster, and thereafter the 
insects disperse. 

The insects swarm in an area that centers 
around a summoning point determined by 
the spellcaster; the point can be up to 120 
yards away from the priest. The insect 
plague does not move thereafter for as long 
as it lasts. Note that the spell can be coun- 
tered by a dispel magic spell. 

The material components of this spell are 
a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, 
and a smear of fat. 


Magic Font (Divination) 


Sphere: Divination 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The spell causes a holy water font to serve 
as a scrying device. The spell does not func- 
tion unless the priest is in good standing 
with his deity. The basin of holy water be- 
comes similar to a crystal ball. For each vial 
of capacity of the basin, the priest may scry 
for one round, up to a maximum of one 
hour; thus, the duration of the magic font 
spell is directly related to the size of the holy 
water receptacle. The DM will know the 
chances of a character being able to detect 
scrying. 

The priest's holy symbol and the font and 
its trappings are not consumed by the spell. 


Moonbeam (Evocation, Alteration) 


Sphere: Sun 

Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 7 

Saving Throw: None 

Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere 
(plus special) 

Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster is able to 
cause a beam of soft, pale light to strike 
downward from overhead and illuminate 
whatever area he is pointing at. The light is 
exactly the same as moonlight, so that col- 
ors other than shades of black, gray, or 
white are vague. The spellcaster can easily 
make the moonbeam move to any area that 
he can see and point to. This makes the spell 
an effective way to spotlight something, an 
opponent, for example. While the moon- 
beam spell does not eliminate all shadows, a 
creature centered in a moonbeam is most 
certainly visible. The reflected light from 
this spell enables dim visual perception 10 
yards beyond the area of effect, but it does 
not shed a telltale glow that would negate 


223 


surprise. The light does not adversely affect 
infravision. The caster can dim the beam to 
near darkness if desired. The beam has, in 
addition, all the properties of true moon- 
light and can induce a lycanthropic change 
(while in the beam), unless your DM rules 
otherwise. 

The material components are several 
seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of 
opalescent feldspar (moonstone). 


Pass Plant (Alteration) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By using this spell, the caster is able to en- 
ter a tree and move from inside it to inside 
another tree of the same type that lies in ap- 
proximately the direction desired by the 
spell user and is within the range shown in 
the following table. 


Type of Tree Range of Area of Effect 
Oak 


600 yards 

Ash 540 yards 
Yew 480 yards 
Elm 420 yards 
Linden 360 yards 
deciduous 300 yards 
coniferous 240 yards 
other 180 yards 


The tree entered and that receiving the 
caster must be of the same type, must both 
be living, and of girth at least equal to that 
of the caster. Note that if the caster enters a 
tree, an ash, for example, and wishes to pass 
north as far as possible (540 yards), but the 
only appropriate ash in range is to the 
south, the caster will pass to the ash in the 
south. The pass plant spell functions so that 
the movement takes only one round. The 
caster can, at his option, remain within the 
receiving tree for a maximum of one round 
per level of experience. Otherwise, he can 
step forth immediately. Should no like tree 
be in range, the caster simply remains 
within the tree, does not pass elsewhere, 
and must step forth in the appropriate num- 
ber of rounds. If the occupied tree is 
chopped down or burned, the caster is slain 
he does not exit before the process is com- 
plete. 


Priest Spells (5th Level) 


Plane Shift (Alteration) 


Sphere: Astral 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Creature touched (special) 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


When the plane shift spell is cast, the 
priest moves himself or some other creature 
to another plane of existence. The recipient 
of the spell remains in the new plane until 
sent forth by some like means. If several 
persons link hands in a circle, up to eight 
can be affected by the plane shift at the same 
time. 

The material component of this spell is a 
small, forked metal rod—the exact size and 
metal type dictating to which plane of exist- 
ence (including sub-planes and alternate 
dimensions) the spell sends the affected 
creatures. (Your DM will determine specifics 
regarding how and what planes are 
reached.) 

An unwilling victim must be touched 
(successful attack roll) in order to be sent; in 
addition, the creature is also allowed a sav- 
ing throw. If the saving throw is successful, 
the effect of the spell is negated. Note that 
pinpoint accuracy is rarely achieved; arriv- 
ing a random distance from an intended des- 
tination is common. 

The metal rod is not expended when the 
spell is cast. Forked rods keyed to certain 
planes may be difficult to come by, as decid- 
ed by the DM. 


Quest (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Charm 

Range: 60 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Until fulfilled 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The quest spell enables the priest to 
require the affected creature to perform a 
service and return to the priest with proof 
that the deed was accomplished. The quest 
can, for example, require that the creature 
locate and return some important or valu- 
able object, rescue a notable person, release 
some creature, capture a stronghold, slay a 
person, deliver some item, and so forth. If 
the quest is not properly followed, due to 
disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature 
affected by the spell loses 1 from its saving 
throw rolls for each day of such action. This 
penalty is not removed until the quest is 
properly pursued or the priest cancels it. 
(There are certain circumstances that will 
temporarily suspend a quest, and others 
that will discharge or cancel it; your DM 
will give you appropriate information as the 


need to know arises.) 

If cast upon an unwilling subject, the vic- 
tim is allowed a saving throw. However if 
the person quested agrees to a task, even if 
the agreement is gained by force or trickery, 
no saving throw is allowed. If a quest is just 
and deserved, a creature of the priest's reli- 
gion cannot avoid it, and any creature of the 
priest's alignment saves with a —4 penalty 
to the saving throw, in any case. A quest 
cannot be dispelled but can be removed by a 
priest of the same religion or of higher level 
than the caster. Some artifacts and relics 
might negate the spell, as can direct inter- 
vention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or 
undeserved quest grants bonuses to its sav- 
ing throws, or might even automatically 
fail! 

The material component of this spell is 
the priest's holy symbol. 


Rainbow (Evocation, Alteration) 


Sphere: Weather, Sun 
Range: 120 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


In order to cast this spell, the priest must 
be in sight of a rainbow of any sort, or have 
a special component (see below). The rain- 
bow spell has two applications, and the 
priest can choose the desired one at the time 
of casting. These applications are as fol- 
lows: 

Bow: The spell creates a shimmering, 
multi-layered short composite bow of rain- 
bow hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that 
any character can use it without penalty for 
non-proficiency. It is magical: Each of its 
shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a 
+2 weapon, including attack and damage 
bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the 
effect of any missile fired from the bow. The 
bow fires seven missiles before disappear- 
ing. It can be fired up to four times per 
round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue 
leaves the bow, corresponding to the color 
of arrow that is released. Each color of 
arrow has the ability to cause double dam- 
age to certain creatures, as follows: 
Red—fire dwellers/users and fire elementals 
Orange—creatures or constructs of clay, 

sand, earth, stone or similar mate- 
rials, and earth elementals 
Yellow—vegetable opponents (including 
fungus creatures, shambling 
mounds, treants, etc.) 
Green—aquatic creatures and water ele- 
mentals 
Blue—aerial creatures, electricity-using 
creatures, and air elementals. 
Indigo—acid-using or poison-using crea- 
tures 


224 ( 


Violet—metallic or regenerating creatures 


When the bow is drawn, an arrow of the 
appropriate color magically appears, 
nocked and ready. If no color is requested, 
or a color that has already been used is 
asked for, then the next arrow (in the order 
of the spectrum) appears. 

Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to 
form a seven-hued bridge up to three feet 
wide per level of the caster. It must be at 
least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 
yards, according to the caster’s desire. It 
lasts as long as the spell duration or until 
ordered out of existence by the caster. 

The components for this spell are the 
priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy 
water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the 
caster can substitute a diamond of not less 
than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with 
bless and prayer spells while in sight of a 
rainbow. The holy water and diamond dis- 
appear when the spell is cast. 


Raise Dead (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: Special 


When the priest casts a raise dead spell, he 
can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, 
halfling, or human (other creatures may be 
allowed, at the DM's option). The length of 
time that the person has been dead is of 
importance, as the priest can raise persons 
dead only up to a limit of one day for each 
experience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th- 
level priest can raise a person who has been 
dead for up to nine days). 

Note that the body of the person must be 
whole, or otherwise missing parts are still 
missing when the person is brought back to 
life. Likewise, other ills, such as poison and 
disease, are not negated. The raised person 
must roll a successful resurrection survival 
check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3: 
Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitu- 
tion. Furthermore, the raised person is weak 
and helpless in any event, and he needs a 
minimum of one full day of rest in bed for 
each day or fraction he was dead. The per- 
son has but 1 hit point when raised and must 
regain the rest by natural healing or curative 
magic. 

Note that a character's starting Constitu- 
tion is an absolute limit to the number of 
times the character can be revived by this 
means. 

The somatic component of the spell is a 
pointed finger. 

The reverse of the spell, slay living, 


Priest Spells (5th Level) 


grants the victim a saving throw vs. death 
magic, and if it is successful, the victim sus- 
tains damage equal only to that of a cause 
serious wounds spell—i.e., 2d8+1 points. 
Failure means the victim dies instantly. 


Spike Stones (Alteration, Enchantment) 


Sphere: Elemental (Earth) 

Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 3d4 turns + 1/level 

Casting Time: 6 

Area of Effect: 10-foot square per level, 1 
spike per 1-foot sq. 

Saving Throw: None 


The spike stones spell causes rock to 
shape itself into long, sharp points that tend 
to blend into the background. It is effective 
on both natural rock and worked stone. The 
spike stones serve to impede progress 
through an area and to inflict damage. If an 
area is carefully observed, each observer is 
25% likely to notice the sharp points of 
rock. Otherwise, those entering the spell’s 
area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage 
per round. The success of each attack is 
determined as if the caster of the spell were 
actually engaging in combat. Those enter- 
ing the area are subject to attack immedi- 
ately upon setting foot in the area and for 
each round spent in the area thereafter. The 
initial step enables the individual to become 
aware of some problem only if the initial 
attack succeeds; otherwise movement con- 
tinues and the spike stones remain unno- 
ticed until damage occurs. Charging or 
running victims suffer two attacks per 
round. 

Those falling into pits affected by spike 
stones suffer six such attacks for every 10 
feet fallen, each attack having a +2 bonus 
to the attack roll. In addition, the damage 
inflicted by each attack increases by +2 for 
every 10 feet fallen. Finally, the creatures 
also suffer any normal falling damage. 

The material component of this spell is 
four tiny stalactites. 


Transmute Rock to Mud (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Earth, Water) 
Range: 160 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell turns natural rock of any sort 
into an equal volume of mud. If it is cast 
upon a rock, for example, the rock affected 
collapses into mud. Magical or enchanted 
stone is not affected by the spell. The depth 
of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. 


Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or other- 
wise free themselves from the mud sink at 
the rate of /s of their height per round and 
eventually suffocate, save for lightweight 
creatures that could normally pass across 
such ground. Brush thrown atop the mud 
can support creatures able to climb on top 
of it, with the amount required decided by 
the DM. Creatures large enough to walk on 
the bottom can move through the area at a 
rate of 10 feet per round. 

The mud remains until a successful dispel 
magic or transmute mud to rock spell 
restores its substance—but not necessarily 
its form. Evaporation turns the mud to nor- 
mal dirt at a rate of 1d6 days per 10 cubic 
feet. The exact time depends on exposure to 
the sun, wind, and normal drainage. 

The reverse, transmute mud to rock, 
hardens normal mud or quicksand into soft 
stone (sandstone or similar mineral) perma- 
nently unless magically changed. Creatures 
in the mud are allowed a saving throw to 
escape before the area is hardened to stone. 
Dry sand is unaffected. 

The material components for the spell are 
clay and water (or sand, lime, and water for 
the reverse). 


True Seeing (Divination) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Divination 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When the priest employs this spell, he 
confers upon the recipient the ability to see 
all things as they actually are. The spell pen- 
etrates normal and magical darkness. Secret 
doors become plain. The exact location of 
displaced things is obvious. Invisible things 
become quite visible. Illusions and appari- 
tions are seen through. Polymorphed, 
changed, or enchanted things are apparent. 
Even the aura projected by creatures 
becomes visible, so that alignment can be 
discerned. Furthermore, the recipient can 
focus his vision to see into the Ethereal plane 
or the bordering areas of adjacent planes. 
The range of vision co is 120 feet. 
True seeing, however, does not penetrate 
solid objects; it in no way confers X-ray 
vision or its equivalent. Furthermore, the 
spell effects cannot be further enhanced 
with known magic. 

The spell requires an ointment for the 
eyes that is made from very rare mushroom 
powder, saffron, and fat and costs no less 
than 300 gp per use. 

The reverse, false seeing, causes the per- 
son to see things as they are not: rich is poor, 
rough is smooth, beautiful is ugly. The oint- 


225 


ment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil, 
poppy dust, and pink orchid essence. 

For both spells, the ointment must be 
aged for 1d6 months. 


Wall of Fire (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: 80 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The wall of fire spell brings forth an 
immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of 

i ing color—yellow-green or amber 
(different from the 4th-level wizard ver- 
sion). The spell creates an opaque sheet of 
flame up to one 20-foot square per level of 
the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up 
to 10 feet + five feet for every two levels of 
experience of the wizard, and 20 feet high. 

The wall of fire must be cast so that it is 
vertical with respect to the caster. One side 
of the wall, selected by the caster, sends 
forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of 
damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 
1d4 points of damage upon those within 20 
feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 4d4 points 
of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level 
of the spellcaster, to any creature passing 
through it. Creatures especially subject to 
fire may take additional damage, and 
undead always take twice normal damage, 
Note that attempting to directly catch mov- 
ing creatures with a newly created wall of 
fire is difficult; a successful saving throw 
enables the creature to avoid the wall, while 
its rate and direction of movement deter- 
mine which side of the created wall it is on. 
The wall of fire lasts as long as the priest 
concentrates on maintaining it, or one 
round per level of experience of the priest in 
the event he does not wish to concentrate 
upon it. 

The material component of the spell is 
phosphorus. 


Priest Spells (6th Level) 


Sixth-Level Spells 


Aerial Servant 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Summoning 
Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 day/level 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell summons an invisible aerial ser- 
vant to find and bring back an object or 
creature described to it by the priest. Unlike 
an elemental, an aerial servant cannot be 
commanded to fight for the caster. When it 
is summoned, the priest must have cast a 
protection from evil spell, be within a pro- 
tective circle, or have a special item used to 
control the aerial servant. Otherwise, it 
attempts to slay its summoner and return 
from whence it came. 

The object or creature to be brought must 
be such as to allow the aerial servant to 
physically bring it to the priest (an aerial 
servant can carry at least 1,000 pounds). If 
prevented, for any reason, from completing 
the assigned duty, the aerial servant 
becomes insane and seeks out and attempts 
to destroy the caster. The aerial servant 
returns to its own plane whenever the spell 
lapses, its duty is fulfilled, it is dispelled, the 
priest releases it, or the priest is slain. The 
spell lasts for a maximum of one day for 
each level of experience of the priest who 
cast it. 

If the creature to be fetched cannot detect 
invisible objects, the aerial servant attacks, 
automatically gaining surprise. If the crea- 
ture involved can detect invisible objects, it 
still suffers a —2 penalty to all surprise rolls 
caused by the aerial servant. Each round of 
combat, the aerial servant must roll to 
attack. When a hit is scored, the aerial ser- 
vant has grabbed the item or creature it was 
sent for. A creature with a Strength rating is 
allowed an evasion roll, equal to twice its 
bend bars chance, to escape the hold. If the 
creature in question does not have a 
Strength rating, roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the 
aerial servant and the creature grabbed 
have. The higher total is the stronger. Once 
seized, the creature cannot free itself by 
Strength or Dexterity and is flown to the 
priest forthwith. 


Animal Summoning Ill 
(Conjuration, Summoning) 


Sphere: Animal, Summoning 
Range: 100 yards/level 
Components: V, S 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell is the same in duration and 
effect as the 4th-level animal summoning I 
spell, except that up to four animals of no 
more than 16 Hit Dice each can be summon- 
ed, or eight of no more than 8 Hit Dice, or 
16 creatures of no more than 4 Hit Dice. 
Only animals within range of the caster at 
the time the spell is cast will come. The cast- 
er can try three times to summon three dif- 
ferent types of animals—e.g., suppose that 
wild dogs are first summoned to no avail, 
then hawks are unsuccessfully called, and 
finally the caster calls for wild horses that 
may or may not be within summoning 
range. Your DM will determine the chance 
of a summoned animal type being within 
range of the spell. The animals summoned 
will aid the caster by whatever means they 
possess, staying until a fight is over, a spe- 
cific mission is finished, the caster is safe, he 
sends them away, etc. Only normal or giant 
animals can be summoned; fantastic ani- 
mals or monsters cannot be summoned by 
this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, 
manticores, etc.). 


Animate Object (Alteration) 
Sphere: Creation, Summoning 


Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level 
Saving Throw: None 


This powerful spell enables the priest 
casting it to imbue inanimate objects with 
mobility and a semblance of life. The ani- 
mated object, or objects, then attacks 
whomever or whatever the priest first desig- 
nates. The animated object can be of any 
nonmagical material whatsoever—wood, 
metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, 
etc. Attempting to animate an object in 
someone's possession grants that person a 
saving throw to prevent the spell’s effect. 
The speed of movement of the object 
depends on its means of propulsion and its 
weight. A large wooden table would be 
rather heavy, but its legs would give it 
speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar 
would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal 
would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a 
stone statue would move at 40 feet per 
round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, 
an ivory stool of light weight would move at 


226 


120 feet per round. Slithering movement is 
about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 
30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage 
caused by the attack of an animated object 
depends on its form and composition. Light, 
supple objects can only o vision, 
obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, 
etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or oth- 
erwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or 
possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, sup- 
ple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects 
can crush or strike for 2d4 points of dam- 
age, while larger and heavier objects may 
inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of dam- 
age. 

The frequency of attack of animated 
objects depends on their method of locomo- 
tion, appendages, and method of attack. 
This varies from as seldom as once every 
five melee rounds to as frequently as once 
per round, The Armor Class of the object 
animated is basically a function of material 
and movement ability. Damage depends on 
the type of weapon and the object struck. A 
sharp cutting weapon is effective against 
fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. 
Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are 
useful against wood, stone, and metal 
objects. Your DM will determine all of these 
factors, as well as how much damage the 
animated object can sustain before being 
destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic 
foot of material for each experience level he 
has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could 
animate one or more objects whose solid 
volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet—a large 
statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen 
average crocks. 


Anti-Animal Shell (Abjuration) 


Sphere: Animal, Protection 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 20’ diameter hemisphere 
Saving Throw: None 


By casting this spell, the caster brings into 
being a hemispherical force field that pre- 
vents the entrance of any sort of living crea- 
ture that is wholly or partially animal (not 
magical or extraplanar). Thus a sprite, a 
giant, or a chimera would be kept out, but 
undead or conjured creatures could pass 
through the shell of force, as could such 
monsters as aerial servants, imps, quasits, 
golems, elementals, etc. The anti-animal 
shell functions normally against cross- 
breeds, such as cambions, and lasts for one 
turn for each level of experience the caster 
has attained. Forcing the barrier against 
creatures strains and ultimately collapses 
the field. 

The spell requires the caster’s holy symbol 
and a handful of pepper. 


Priest Spells (6th Level) 


Blade Barrier (Evocation) 


Sphere: Guardian, Creation 
Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 3 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 


The priest employs this spell to set up a 
wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These 
whirl and flash around a central point, cre- 
ating an immobile barrier. Any creature 
that attempts to pass through the blade bar- 
rier suffers 8d8 points of damage in doing 
so. The plane of rotation of the blades can 
be horizontal, vertical, or in between. Crea- 
tures within the area of the barrier when it is 
invoked are entitled to a saving throw vs. 
spell. If this is successful, the blades are 
avoided and no damage is suffered; the 
creature escapes the area of the blade barrier 
by the shortest possible route. The barrier 
remains for three rounds for every experi- 
ence level of the priest casting it. The barrier 
can cover any area from as small as five feet 
square to as large as 60 feet square. 


Conjure Animals 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Summoning 
Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The conjure animals spell enables the 
priest to magically create one or more mam- 
mals to attack his opponents. The total Hit 
Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice 
his level, if the creature conjured is deter- 
mined randomly, or his level, if a specific 
animal type is requested. The DM selects 
the type of animal that appears if it is ran- 
domly called. Thus, a priest of 12th level 
could randomly conjure two mammals with 
12 Hit Dice each, four with 6 Hit Dice each, 
six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit 
Dice each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice each, or 24 
with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit 
point added to a creature's Hit Dice as 1/« of 
a Hit Die. Thus a creature with 4+3 Hit 
Dice equals a 47/4 Hit Dice creature. The 
conjured animals remain for two rounds for 
each level of the conjuring priest, or until 
slain, and they follow the caster’s verbal 
commands. Conjured animals unfailingly 
attack the priest's opponents, but resist 
being used for any other purpose; they do 
not like it, become noticeably more difficult 
to control, and may refuse any action, 
break free, or turn on the caster, depending 
on the nature of the creature and the details 


of the situation. The conjured animals dis- 
appear when slain. 


Conjure Fire Elemental 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: 80 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 6 rounds 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


Upon casting a conjure fire elemental 
spell, the caster opens a special gate to the 
elemental plane of Fire, and a fire elemental 
is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcast- 
er. It is 65% likely that a 12 Hit Dice elemen- 
tal appears, 20% likely that a 16 Hit Dice 
elemental appears, 9% likely that two to 
four salamanders appear, 4% likely that an 
efreeti appears, and 2% likely that a huge 
fire elemental of 21 to 24 Hit Dice appears. 
The conjuring caster need not fear that the 
elemental force summoned will turn on him, 
so concentration upon the activities of the 
fire elemental (or other creatures summon- 
ed) or protection from the creature is not 
necessary. The elemental summoned helps 
the caster however possible, including 
attacking opponents of the caster. The fire 
elemental or other creature summoned 
remains for a maximum of one turn per level 
of the caster, or until it is slain, sent back by 
a dispel magic spell, the reverse of this spell 
(dismiss fire elemental), or similar magic. 


Find the Path (Divination) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Divination 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 3 rounds 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The recipient of this spell can find the 
shortest, most direct physical route that he 
is seeking, be it the way into or out of a 
locale. The locale can be outdoors or under 
ground, a trap, or even a maze spell. Note 
that the spell works with respect to locales, 
not objects or creatures within a locale. 
Thus, the spell could not find the way to “a 
forest where a green dragon lives” or to the 
location of “a hoard of platinum pieces.” 
The location must be in the same plane as 
the caster. 

The spell enables the subject to sense the 
correct direction that will eventually lead 
him to his destination, indicating at the 
appropriate times the exact path to follow 
(or physical actions to take—for example, 


227 


with concentration the spell enables the sub- 
ject to sense trip wires or the proper word to 
bypass a glyph). The spell ends when the 
destination is reached or when one turn for 
each caster level has elapsed. The spell frees 
the subject, and those with him, from a 
maze spell in a single round, and will con- 
tinue to do so as long as the spell lasts. 

Note that this divination is keyed to the 
caster, not his companions, and that, like 
the find traps spell, it does not predict or 
allow for the actions of creatures. 

The spell requires a set of divination 
counters of the sort favored by the priest— 
bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes, 
or whatever. 

The reverse spell, lose the path, makes the 
creature touched totally lost and unable to 
find its way for the duration of the spell, 
although it can be led, of course. 


Fire Seeds (Conjuration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 round/seed 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: ?/2 


The fire seeds spell creates special missiles 
or timed incendiaries that burn with great 
heat. The spell can be cast to create either 
fire seed missiles or fire seed incendiaries, as 
chosen when the spell is cast. 

* Fire seed missiles: This casting turns up 
to four acorns into special grenade-like mis- 
siles that can be hurled up to 40 yards. An 
attack roll is required to strike the intended 
target, and proficiency penalties are consid- 
ered. Each acorn bursts upon striking any 
hard surface, causing 2d8 points of damage 
and igniting any combustible materials 
within a 10-foot diameter of the point of 
impact. If a successful saving throw vs. spell 
is made, a creature within the burst area 
receives only one-half damage, but a crea- 
ture struck directly suffers full damage (i.e., 
no saving throw). 

* Fire seed incendiaries. This casting turns 
up to eight holly berries into special incendi- 
aries. The holly berries are most often 
placed, being too light to make effective 
missiles (they can be tossed up to six feet 
away). They burst into flame if the caster is 
within 40 yards and speaks a word of com- 
mand. The berries instantly ignite, causing 
1d8 points of damage to any creature and 
igniting any combustible within a five-foot- 
diameter burst area. Creatures within the 
area that successfully save vs. spell suffer 
half damage. 


All fire seeds lose their power after a 
duration equal to one turn per experience 
level of the caster—e.g., the seeds of a 13th- 
level caster remain potent for a maximum of 


13 turns after their creation, 
No other material components beyond 
acorns or holly berries are needed for this 


spell. 


Forbiddance (Abjuration) 


Sphere: Protection 

Range: 30 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 6 rounds 

Area of Effect: One 60-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: Special 


This spell can be used to secure a conse- 
crated area (see DMG). The spell seals the 
area from teleportation, plane shifting, and 
ethereal penetration. At the option of the 
caster, the ward can be locked by a 
password, in which case it can be entered 
only by those speaking the proper words. 
Otherwise, the effect on those entering the 
enchanted area is based on their alignment, 
relative to the caster’s. The most severe pen- 
alty is used. 

Alignment identical: No effect. If 
password locked, cannot enter area unless 
password is known (no saving throw). 

Alignment different with respect to law 
and chaos: Save vs. spell to enter the area; if 
failed, suffer 2d6 points of damage. If 
password locked, cannot enter unless 
password is known. 

Alignment different with respect to good 
and evil: Save vs. spell to enter this area; if 
failed, suffer 4d6 points of damage. If word 
locked, cannot enter unless password is 
known. The attempt does cause damage if 
the save is failed. 

Once a saving throw is failed, an intruder 
cannot enter the forbidden area until the 
spell ceases. The ward cannot be dispelled 
by a caster of lesser level than the one who 
established it. Intruders who enter by roll- 
ing successful saving throws feel uneasy and 
tense, despite their success. 

In addition to the priest's holy symbol, 
components include holy water and rare 
incenses worth at least 1,000 gp per 60-foot 
cube. If a password lock is desired, this also 
requires the burning of rare incenses worth 
at least 5,000 gp per 60-foot cube. 


Priest Spells (6th Level) 


Heal (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Healing 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The very potent heal spell enables the 
priest to wipe away disease and injury in the 
creature who receives the benefits of the 
spell. It completely cures all diseases or 
blindness of the recipient and heals all 
points of damage suffered due to wounds or 
injury. It dispels a feeblemind spell. It cures 
those mental disorders caused by spells or 
injury to the brain. Naturally, the effects can 
be negated by later wounds, injuries, and 
diseases. 

The reverse, harm, infects the victim with 
a disease and causes loss of all but 1d4 hit 
points, if a successful touch is inflicted. For 
creatures that are not affected by the heal 
(or harm) spell, see the cure light wounds 


spell. 


Heroes’ Feast (Evocation) 


Sphere: Creation 

Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 hour 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 1 individual/level 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the priest to bring forth 
a great feast that serves as many creatures as 
the priest has levels of experience. The spell 
creates a magnificent table, chairs, service, 
and all the necessary food and drink. The 
feast takes one full hour to consume, and 
the beneficial effects do not set in until after 
this hour is over. Those partaking of the 
feast are cured of all diseases, are immune to 
poison for 12 hours, and are healed of 
1d4 +4 points of damage after imbibing the 
nectar-like beverage that is part of the feast. 
The ambrosia-like food that is consumed is 
equal to a bless spell that lasts for 12 hours. 
Also, during this same period, the people 
who consumed the feast are immune to fear, 
hopelessness, and panic. If the feast is inter- 
rupted for any reason, the spell is ruined 
and all effects of the spell are negated. 

The material components of the spell are 
the priest's holy symbol and specially fer- 
mented honey taken from the cells of bee 
larvae destined for royal status. 


228 


Liveoak (Enchantment) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 day/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: 1 oak tree 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the caster to charm a 
healthy oak tree (or other type if the DM 
allows) to cause it to serve as a protector. 
The spell can be cast on a single tree at a 
time. While a liveoak spell cast by a particu- 
lar caster is in effect, he cannot cast another 
such spell. The tree upon which the spell is 
cast must be within 10 feet of the caster’s 
dwelling place, within a place sacred to the 
caster, or within 100 yards of something 
that the caster wishes to guard or protect. 

The liveoak spell can be cast upon a 
healthy tree of small, medium, or large size, 
according to desire and availability. A trig- 
gering phrase of up to a maximum of one 
word per level of the spellcaster is then 
placed upon the targeted oak; for instance, 
“Attack any persons who come near with- 
out first saying ‘sacred mistletoe’ ” is an 11- 
word trigger phrase that could be used by a 
caster of 11th level or higher casting the 
spell. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into 
animating as a treant of equivalent size, an 
Armor Class of 0 and with two attacks per 
round, but with only a 30-foot-per-round 
movement rate. 


Damage 
per 
Tree Size Height Hit Dice Attack 
Small 12'-14’ 7-8 2d8 
Medium 16'-19’ 9-10 3d6 
Large 20'-23' + 11-12 4d6 


A tree enchanted by this spell radiates a 
magical aura (if checked for), and can be 
returned to normal by a successful casting 
of a dispel magic spell, or upon the desire of 
the caster who enchanted it. If dispelled, the 
tree takes root immediately. If released by 
the caster, it tries to return to its original 
location before taking root. Damage to the 
tree can be healed with a plant growth spell, 
which restores 3d4 points of damage. A 
plant growth spell used in this fashion does 
not increase the size or hit points of the 
liveoak beyond the original value. 

The caster needs his holy symbol to cast 
this spell. 


Priest Spells (6th Level) 


Part Water (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Water) 
Range: 20 yards/level 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By employing a part water spell, the 
priest is able to cause water or similar liquid 
to move apart, thus forming a trough. The 
depth and length of the trough created by 
the spell depends on the level of the priest. A 
trough three feet deep per caster level, by 30 
yards wide, by 20 yards long per level is cre- 
ated. Thus at 12th level, the priest would 
part water 36 feet deep by 30 yards wide by 
240 yards long. The trough remains as long 
as the spell lasts or until the priest who cast 
it opts to end its effects. Existing currents 
appear to flow through the parted water, 
although swimming creatures and physical 
objects such as boats do not enter the rift 
without strenuous and deliberate effort. If 
cast underwater, this spell creates an air cyl- 
inder of appropriate length and diameter. If 
cast directly on a water elemental or other 
water-based creature, the creature receives 
4d8 points of damage and must roll a suc- 
cessful saving throw vs. spell or flee in panic 
for 3d4 rounds. 

The material component of this spell is 
the priest's holy symbol. 


Speak With Monsters (Alteration) 


Sphere: Divination 
Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 2 round/level 
Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 


When cast, the speak with monsters spell 
enables the priest to converse with any type 
of creature that has any form of communi- 
cative ability (including empathic, tactile, 
pheromonic, etc.). That is, the monster 
understands, in its own language or equiva- 
lent, the intent of what is said to it by the 
priest and vice versa. The creature thus spo- 
ken to is checked by your DM in order to 
determine reaction. All creatures of the 
same type as that chosen by the priest can 
likewise understand if they are within 
range. The priest can speak to different 
types of creatures during the spell duration, 
but he must speak separately to each type. 
The spell lasts for two rounds per caster 
level. 


Stone Tell (Divination) 


Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Divination 
Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 turn 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 1 cubic yard of stone 
Saving Throw: None 


When the priest casts a stone fell spell 
upon an area, the very stones speak and 
relate to the caster who or what has touched 
them as well as telling what is covered, con- 
cealed, or simply behind them. The stones 
relate complete descriptions, if asked. Note 
that a stone's perspective, perception, and 
knowledge may hinder this divination; such 
details, if any, are decided by the DM. 

The material components for this spell are 
a drop of mercury and a bit of clay. 


Transmute Water to Dust (Alteration) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Water, Earth) 
Range: 60 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 8 

Area of Effect: 1 cubic yard/level 
Saving Throw: Special 


When this spell is cast, the subject area 
instantly undergoes a change from liquid to 
powdery dust. Note that if the water is 
already muddy, the area of effect is doubled, 
while if wet mud is present, the area of effect 
is quadrupled. If water remains in contact 
with the transmuted dust, the former quick- 
ly permeates the latter, turning the dust into 
silty mud, if a sufficient quantity of water 
exists to do so, otherwise soaking or damp- 
ening the dust accordingly. 

Only the liquid actually in the area of 
effect at the moment of spellcasting is affect- 
ed. Potions that contain water as a compo- 
nent part are rendered useless. Living 
creatures are unaffected, except for those 
native to the elemental plane of Water. Such 
creatures must roll a successful saving 
throws vs. death or be slain; however, only 
one such creature can be affected by any sin- 
gle casting of this spell, regardless of the 
creature's size or the size of the spell’s area of 
effect. 

The reverse of this spell is simply a very 
high-powered create water spell that 
requires a pinch of normal dust as an addi- 
tional material component. 

For either usage of the spell, other compo- 
nents required are diamond dust of at least 
500 gp value, a bit of seashell, and the cast- 
er’s holy symbol. 


229 


Transport Via Plants (Alteration) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster is able to 
enter any large plant (human-sized or larg- 
er) and pass any distance to a plant of the 
same species in a single round, regardless of 
the distance, separating the two. The entry 
plant must be alive. The destination plant 
need not be familiar to the caster, but it also 
must be alive. If the caster is uncertain of the 
destination plant, he need merely determine 
direction and distance, and the transport via 
plants spell moves him as close as possible 
to the desired location. There is a basic 20% 
chance, reduced by 1% per level of experi- 
ence of the caster, that the transport delivers 
the caster to a similar species of plant from 1 
to 100 miles away from the desired destina- 
tion plant. If a particular destination plant is 
desired, but the plant is not living, the spell 
fails and the caster must come forth from 
the entrance plant within 24 hours. Note 
that this spell does not function with plant- 
like creatures—e.g., shambling mounds, 
treants, etc. The destruction of an occupied 
plant slays the caster (see the plant door 
spell). 


Turn Wood (Alteration) 


Sphere: Plant 

Range: 0 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 round/level 

Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: 120-foot-wide path, 
20 feet long/level 

Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, waves of force roll 
forth from the caster, moving in the direc- 
tion he faces, and causing all wooden 
objects in the path of the spell to be pushed 
away from the caster to the limit of the area 
of effect. Wooden objects above three inch- 
es in diameter that are fixed firmly are not 
affected, but loose objects (movable man- 
tles, siege towers, etc.) move back. Objects 
under three inches in diameter that are fixed 
splinter and break, and the pieces move 
with the wave of force. Thus, objects such 
as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon 
shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are 
pushed back, dragging those carrying them 
with them. If a spear is planted in order to 
prevent this forced movement, it splinters. 
Even magical items with wooden sections 
are turned, although an anti-magic shell 
blocks the effects. A successful dispel magic 
spell ends the effect. Otherwise, the turn 


Priest Spells (7th Level) 


wood spell lasts for one round for each 
experience level of the caster. 

The waves of force continue to sweep 
down the set path for the spell’s duration, 
pushing back wooden objects in the area of 
effect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round. 
The length of the path is 20 feet per level of 
the caster, thus a 14th-level caster casts a 
turn wood spell with an area of effect 120 
feet wide by 280 feet long, and the spell lasts 
for 14 rounds. Note that after casting the 
spell, the path is set and the caster can then 
do other things or go elsewhere without 


affecting the spell’s power. 


Wall of Thorns 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Plant, Creation 

Range: 80 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 turn/level 

Casting Time: 9 

Area of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level 
Saving Throw: None 


The wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of 
very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing 
need| thorns as long as a person’s fin- 
ger. Any creature breaking through (or 
crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8 
points of damage, plus an additional amount 
of damage equal to the creature's AC. Nega- 
tive ACs subtract from the base 8 points of 
damage, but no adjustment is made for Dex- 
terity. Any creature within the area of effect 
of the spell when it is cast crashes into the 
wall of thorns, and must break through to 
move. The damage is based on each 10-foot 
thickness of the barrier. 

If the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes 
at least four turns to cut a path through a 10- 
foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the 
barrier, but magical fires burn away the bar- 
rier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect 
while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this 
case, the cool side of the wall is that closest 
to the caster of the thorn wall. 

The nearest edge of the wall of thorns 
appears up to 80 yards distant from the cast- 
er, as he desires. The spell lasts for one turn 
for each level of experience of the caster, 
covers one 10-foot cube per level of the cast- 
er in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus 
a 14th-level caster could create a wall of 
thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or 
deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot- 
high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall 
to block a dungeon passage, or any other 
sort of shape that suited his needs. The cast- 
er can also create a wall of five-foot thick- 
ness, which inflicts half damage but can be 
doubled in one of the other dimensions. 
Note that those with the ability to pass 
through overgrown areas are not hindered 
by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the 
barrier on command. 


Weather Summoning 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Weather 
Range: 0 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 turn 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By this spell, the caster calls forth weather 
appropriate to the climate and season of the 
area he is in at the time. Thus, in spring a 
tornado, thunderstorm, cold, sleet storm, 
or hot weather could be summoned. In sum- 
mer a torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm, 
etc., can be called for. In autumn, hot or 
cold weather, fog, sleet, etc., could be sum- 
moned, Winter enables great cold, blizzard, 
or thaw conditions to be summoned. 
Hurricane-force winds can be summoned 
near coastal regions in the late winter or ear- 
ly spring. The summoned weather is not 
under the control of the caster. It might last 
but a single turn, in the case of a tornado, or 
for hours or even days in other cases. The 
area of effect likewise varies from about one 
square mile to 100 square miles. Note that 
several casters can act in concert to greatly 
affect weather, controlling winds, and 
working jointly to summon very extreme 
weather conditions. 

Within four turns after the spell is cast, 
the trend of the weather to come is 
apparent—e.g., clearing skies, gusts of 
warm or hot air, a chill breeze, overcast 
skies, etc. Summoned weather arrives 
1d12+5 turns after the spell is cast. Note 
that the new weather condition cannot be 
changed by the caster once it has been sum- 
moned. Once the weather is fully summon- 
ed, it cannot be dispelled. If the summoning 
is successfully dispelled before it has been 
completed, the weather slowly reverts to its 
original condition. 


Word of Recall (Alteration) 


Sphere: Summoning 
Range: 0 
Components: V 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


The word of recall spell takes the priest 
instantly back to his sanctuary when the 
word is uttered. The sanctuary must be spe- 
cifically designated in advance by the priest 
and must be a well-known place. The actual 
point of arrival is a designated area no larg- 
er than 10’ X 10’. The priest can be trans- 
ported any distance, from above or below 
ground. Transportation by the word of 
recall spell is safe within a plane, but for 
each plane the priest is removed, there is a 


230 


10% cumulative chance that the priest is 
irrevocably lost. The priest is able to trans- 
port, in addition to himself, 25 pounds of 
weight per experience level. Thus, a 15th- 
level priest could transport his person and 
an additional 375 pounds weight. This extra 
matter can be equipment, treasure, or even 
living material, such as another person. 
Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. 
Note that unusually strong physical fields 
(e.g., magnetic, gravitational) or magical 
forces can, at the DM's option, make the use 
of this spell hazardous or impossible. 


Seventh-Level Spells 


Animate Rock (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Earth) 
Range: 40 yards 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 2 cubic feet/level 
Saving Throw: None 


By employing an animate rock spell, the 
caster causes a stone object of up to the indi- 
cated size to move (see the 6th-level animate 
object spell.) The animated stone object 
must be separate (not a part of a huge boul- 
der or the like). It follows the desire of the 
caster—attacking, breaking objects, block- 
ing—while the magic lasts. It has no intelli- 
gence or volition of its own, but it follows 
instructions exactly as spoken. Note that 
only one set of instructions for one single 
action (the whole being simply worded and 
very brief—12 words or so) can be given to 
the animated rock. The rock remains ani- 
mated for one round per experience level of 
the caster. The volume of rock that can be 
animated is also based on the experience 
level of the caster—two cubic feet of stone 
per level—e.g., 24 cubic feet, a mass of 
about man-sized, at 12th level. 

While the exact details of the animated 
rock are decided by the DM, its Armor 
Class is no worse than 5, and it has 1d3 hit 


Priest Spells (7th Level) 


points per cubic foot of volume. It uses the 
attack roll of the caster. The maximum dam- 
age it can inflict is 1d2 points per caster level 
(thus, a 12th-level caster’s rock might inflict 
12 to 24 points of damage). Movement, for 
a man-sized rock, is 60 feet per round. A 
rock generally weighs from 100 to 300 
pounds per cubic foot. 

The material components for the spell are 
a stone and drop of the caster’s blood. 


Astral Spell (Alteration) 


Sphere: Astral 

Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 2/2 hour 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of the astral spell, a priest is 
able to project his astral body into the As- 
tral plane, leaving his physical body and 
material possessions behind on the Prime 
Material plane. As the Astral plane touches 
upon the first levels of all the outer planes, 
the priest can travel astrally to the first level 
of any of these outer planes as he wills. The 
priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming 
a body on the plane of existence he has cho- 
sen to enter. It is also possible to travel as- 
trally anywhere in the Prime Material plane 
by means of the astral spell (however, a sec- 
ond body cannot be formed on the Prime 
Material plane; see following). 

As a general rule, a person astrally pro- 
jected can be seen only by creatures on the 
Astral plane. The astral body is connected 
at all times to the material body by a silvery 
cord. If the cord is broken, the affected per- 
son is killed, astrally and materially, but 
generally only the psychic wind can cause 
the cord to break. When a second body is 
formed on a different plane, the silvery cord 
remains invisibly attached to the new body. 
If the second body or astral form is slain, the 
cord simply returns to the caster’s body 
where the body rests on the Prime Material 
plane, reviving it from its state of suspended 
animation. Although astral projections are 
able to function on the Astral plane, their 
actions affect only creatures existing on the 
Astral plane; a physical body must be mate- 
rialized on other planes. 

The spell lasts until the priest desires to 
end it, or until it is terminated by some out- 
side means (such as a dispel magic spell or 
destruction of the priest's body on the Prime 
Material plane [which kills the priest]). The 
priest can project the astral forms of up to 
seven other creatures with himself by means 
of the astral spell, providing the creatures 
are linked in a circle with the priest. These 
fellow travelers are dependent upon the 
priest and can be stranded if something hap- 
pens to the priest, Travel in the Astral plane 


can be slow or fast, according to the priest's 
desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is 
subject to the desire of the priest. 


Changestaff (Evocation, Enchantment) 


Sphere: Plant, Creation 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 4 

Area of Effect: The caster’s staff 
Saving Throw: None 


By means of this spell, the caster is able to 
change a specially prepared staff into a 
treant-like creature of the largest size (about 
24 feet tall). When the priest plants the end 
of the staff in the ground and speaks a spe- 
cial command and invocation, the staff 
turns into a treant-like creature with 12 Hit 
Dice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. It at- 
tacks twice per round, inflicting 4d6 points 
of damage with every successful attack. The 
staff-treant defends the caster and obeys 
any spoken commands. However, it is by no 
means a true treant; it cannot converse with 
actual treants or control trees. The transfor- 
mation lasts either for as many turns as the 
caster has experience levels, until the caster 
commands the staff to return to its true 
form, or until the staff is destroyed, which- 
ever occurs first. If the staff-treant is re- 
duced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a 
sawdust-like powder and the staff is de- 
stroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used 
again after 24 hours and the staff-treant is at 
full strength. 

To cast a changestaff spell, the caster must 
have either his holy symbol or leaves (ash, 
oak, or yew) of the same sort as the staff. 

The staff for the changestaff spell must be 
specially prepared. The staff must be a 
sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew 
tree struck by lightning no more than 24 
hours before the limb is cut. The limb must 
then be cured by sun drying and special 
smoke for 28 days. Then it must be shaped, 
carved, and polished for another 28 days. 
The caster cannot adventure or engage in 
other strenuous activity during either of 
these periods. The finished staff, engraved 
with woodland scenes, is then rubbed with 
the juice of holly berries, and the end of it is 
thrust into the earth of the caster’s grove 
while he casts a speak with plant spell, call- 
ing upon the staff to assist in time of need. 
The item is then charged with a magic that 
will last for many changes from staff to 
treant and back again.

Chariot Of Sustarre (Evocation) 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire), Creation 
Range: 10 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 12 hours 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, it brings forth a 
large, flaming chariot pulled by two fiery 
horses from the elemental plane of Fire. 
These appear in a clap of thunder amid a 
cloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at 24 on 
the ground, 48 flying, and can carry the 
caster and up to seven other creatures of 
man-size or Jess (the passengers must be 
touched by the caster to protect them from 
the flames of the chariot). Creatures other 
than the caster and his designated passen- 
gers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each 
round if they come within five feet of the 
horses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no 
damage if they evade the area by rolling suc- 
cessful saving throws vs. petrification, with 
Dexterity adjustments. 

The caster controls the chariot by verbal 
command, causing the flaming steeds to 
stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn 
left or right as he desires. Note that the char- 
iot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation 
and can sustain damage. The vehicle and 
steeds are struck only by magical weapons 
or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 
point of damage), they are Armor Class 2, 
and each requires 30 points of damage to 
dispel. Naturally, fire has absolutely no ef- 
fect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but 
magical fires other than those of the chariot 
can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a 
successful dispel magic or holy word, will 
force the chariot back to its home plane, 
without its passengers. The chariot can be 
summoned only once per week. 

The material components are a small 
piece of wood, two holly berries, and a fire 
source at least equal to a torch. 


Confusion (Enchantment/Charm) 


Sphere: Charm

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1d4 creatures within

Saving Throw: Special 


This spell causes confusion in one or more 
creatures within the area, creating indeci- 
sion and the inability to take effective 
action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus 
one creature per two caster levels. Thus, 
seven to ten creatures can be affected by a 
12th- or 13th-level caster, eight to 11 by a 
14th- or 15th-level caster, etc. These crea-

The spell lasts one round for each level of 
the caster. Those who fail their saving 
throws are checked by the DM for actions 
each round, for the duration of the spell, or 
until the “wander away for the duration of 
the spell” result occurs. 

Wandering creatures move as far from the 
caster as possible in their most typical mode 
of movement (characters walk, fish swim, 
bats fly, etc.). This is not panicked flight. 
Wandering creatures also have a 50% 


to 24 Hit Dice (20 + 1d4). Furthermore, the 
caster needs but to command it, and it does 
as desired, for the elemental regards the 
caster as a friend to be obeyed. The elemen-

the conjure fire elemental spell), or the spell

If Weather is a major sphere for the priest 
(as it is for druids), duration and area are 
doubled, and the caster can change the pre- 
vailing weather by two places (e.g., he can 
cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy 
to heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool 
to arctic, and wind to go from calm to 
strong).

The control weather spell enables a priest 
to change the weather in the local area. The 
spell affects the weather for 4d12 hours in an 
area of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn 
to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 turns 
for the effects of the spell to be felt. The cur- 
rent weather conditions are decided by the 
DM, depending on the climate and season. 
Weather conditions have three components: 
precipitation, temperature, and wind. The 
spell can change these conditions according

commands. The creeping doom slays any 
creature subject to normal attacks, as each 
of the small horrors inflicts 1 point of dam- 
age (each then dies after its attack), so that 
up to 1,000 points of damage can be in- 
flicted on creatures within the path of the 
creeping doom. If the creeping doom goes 
more than 80 yards away from the sum- 
moner, it loses 50 of its number for each 10 
yards beyond 80 yards (e.g., at 100 yards, 
its number has shrunk by 100). There are a 
number of ways to thwart or destroy the 
creatures forming the swarm. The solutions 
are left to the imaginations of players and 
DMs. 


Earthquake (Alteration) 

Sphere: Elemental (Earth) 

Range: 120 yards 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: 1 round 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: 5-foot diameter/level 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast by a priest, a local 
tremor of fairly high strength rips the 
ground. The shock is over in one round. 
The earthquake affects all terrain, vegeta- 
tion, structures, and creatures in its area of 
effect. The area of effect of the earthquake 
spell is circular, with a diameter of five feet 
for every experience level of the priest cast- 
ing it. Thus a 20th-level priest casts an 
earthquake spell with a 100-foot-diameter 
area of effect. 


Priest Spells (7th Level) 


Solidly built structures with foundations 
reaching down to bedrock sustain one-half 
damage; one-quarter damage if they score 
above 50% on a saving throw. An earth ele- 
mental opposed to the caster in the area of 
effect can negate 10% to 100% (roll 1d10, 
0 = 100%) of the effect. Other magical 
protections and wards allowed by the DM 
may also reduce or negate this effect. If cast 
undersea, this spell may, at the discretion of 
the DM, create a tsunami or tidal wave. 

The material components for this spell are 
a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump 
of clay. 


Exaction (Evocation, Alteration) 


Sphere: Charm, Summoning 
Range: 10 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is employed, the priest 
confronts some powerful creature from an- 
other plane (including devas and other pow- 
erful minions, for instance, but not 
demigods or deities of any sort) and requires 
of it some duty or quest. A creature of an 
alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil if 
the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is law- 
ful) cannot be ordered around unless it is 
willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral 
creature is effectively opposed to both good 
and evil, and both law and chaos.

The spellcaster must know something 
about the creature to exact service from it, 
or else he must offer some fair trade in re- 
turn for the service. That is, if the priest is 
aware that the creature has received some 
favor from someone of the priest's align- 
ment, then the exaction spell can name this 
as cause; if no balancing reason for service is 
known, then some valuable gift or service 
must be pledged in return for the exaction. 
The service exacted must be reasonable with 
respect to the past or promised favor or re- 
ward, and with the being’s effort and risk. 
The spell then acts, subject to a magic resist- 
ance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to 
perform the required service. Immediately 
upon completion of the service, the being is 
transported to the vicinity of the priest, and 
the priest must then and there return the 
promised reward, whether it is irrevocable 
cancellation of a past debt or the giving of 
some service or other material reward. Af- 
ter this is done, the creature is instantly 
freed to return to its own plane. 

The DM adjudicates when an equitable 
arrangement has been reached. If the caster 
requests too much, the creature is free to de- 
part or to attack the priest (as if the agree- 
ment were breached) according to its 
nature. If circumstances leave the situation 
unbalanced (for example, the creature dies 
while achieving a result that was not worth 
the creature dying), then this might create a 
debt owed by the caster to the creature's sur- 
viving kith and kin, making the caster vul- 
nerable to a future exaction from that 
quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or re- 
lease in the event of catastrophic failure or 
death are common caster pledges in securing 
an exaction. 

Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter 
results in the priest being subject to exaction 
by the subject creature or by its master, 
liege, etc., at the very least. At worst, the 
creature may attack the reneging priest 
without fear of any of his spells affecting it, 
for the priest's failure to live up to the bar- 
gain gives the creature total immunity from 
the priest's spell powers. 

The material components of this spell are 
the priest’s holy symbol, some matter or 
substance from the plane of the creature 
from whom an exaction is expected, and 
knowledge of the creature’s nature or 
actions that is written out on a parchment 
that is burned to seal the pledge. 


Priest Spells (7th Level) 


Fire Storm (Evocation) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 

Range: 160 yards 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 round 

Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube/level, mini- 
mum 16 10-foot cubes 

Saving Throw: */2 


When a fire storm spell is cast, the whole 
area is shot through with sheets of roaring 
flame that equal a wall of fire spell in effect. 
Creatures within the area of fire and 10 feet 
or less from the edge of the affected area 
receive 2d8 points of damage plus addition- 
al damage equal to the caster’s level (2d8 + 
1/level). Creatures that roll successful sav- 
ing throws vs. spell suffer only one-half 
damage. The damage is inflicted each round 
the creature stays in the area of effect. The 
area of effect is equal to two 10’ x 10’ cubes 
per level of the caster—e.g., a 13th-level 
caster can cast a fire storm measuring 130’ x 
20' x 10’. The height of the storm is 10 or 20 
feet; the balance of its area must be in length 
and width. 

The reverse spell, fire quench, smothers 
twice the area of effect of a fire storm with 
respect to normal fires, and the normal area 
of effect with respect to magical fires. Fire- 
based creatures, such as elementals, sala- 
manders, etc., of less than demigod status 
have a a 5% chance per experience level of 
the caster of being extinguished. If cast only 
against a flametongue sword, the sword 
must roll a successful saving throw vs. 
crushing blow or be rendered nonmagical. 
Such a sword in the possession of a creature 
first receives the creature's saving throw, 
and if this is successful, the second saving 
throw is automatically successful. 


Gate (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Summoning 
Range: 30 yards 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 5 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


Casting a gate spell has two effects: it 
causes an interdimensional connection 
between the plane of existence the priest is in 
and the plane in which dwells a specific 
being of great power. The result of this con- 
nection is that the sought-after being can 
step through the gate or portal, from its 
plane to that of the priest. Uttering the spell 
attracts the attention of the dweller on the 
other plane. When casting the spell, the 
priest must name the entity he desires to 
make use of the gate and to come to his aid. 


There is a 100% chance that something 
steps through the gate. The actions of the 
being that comes through depend on many 
factors, including the alignment of the 
priest, the nature of those accompanying 
him, and who or what opposes or threatens 
the priest. Your DM will decide the exact 
result of the spell, based on the creature 
called, the desires of the caster and the needs 
of the moment. The being gated in either 
returns immediately or remains to take 
action. Casting this spell ages the priest five 
years. 


Holy Word (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Combat 

Range: 0 

Components: V 

Duration: Special 

Casting Time: 1 

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 


Uttering a holy word spell creates magic 
of tremendous power. It drives off evil crea- 
tures from other planes, forcing them to 
return to their own planes of existence, pro- 
vided the speaker is in his home plane. Crea- 
tures so banished cannot return for at least a 
day. The spell further affects creatures of 
differing alignment as shown on the follow- 
ing table: 


Regenerate (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Necromantic 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 3 rounds 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When a regenerate spell is cast, body 
members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, 
legs, tails, or even the heads of multi-headed 
creatures), bones, and organs grow back. 
The process of regeneration requires but one 
round if the severed member(s) is (are) 
present and touching the creature, 2d4 turns 
otherwise. The creature must be living to 
receive the benefits of this spell. If the sev- 
ered member is not present, or if the injury 
is older than one day per caster level, the 
recipient must rol] a successful system shock 
check to survive the spell. 

The reverse, wither, causes the member 
or organ touched to shrivel and cease func- 
tioning in one round, dropping off into dust 
in 2d4 turns. Creatures must be touched for 
the harmful effect to occur. 

The material components of this spell are 
a prayer device and holy water (or unholy 
water for the reverse).

Affected creatures are those within the 
30-foot-radius area of effect, which is cen- 
tered on the priest casting the spell. The side 
effects are negated for deafened or silenced 
creatures, but such are still driven off if 
other-planar. 

The reverse, unholy word, operates 
exactly the same way but affects creatures 
of good alignment.

Reincarnate (Necromancy) 


Sphere: Necromantic 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Person touched 
Saving Throw: None 


With this spell, the priest can bring back a 
dead person in another body, if death 
occurred no more than one week before the 
casting of the spell. Reincarnation does not 
require any saving throw, system shock, or 
resurrection survival roll. The corpse is 
touched, and a new incarnation of the per- 
son appears in the area in 1d6 turns. The 
person reincarnated recalls the majority of 
his former life and form, but the character 
class, if any, of the new incarnation might 


Priest Spells (7th Level) 


be very different indeed. The new incarna- 
tion is determined on the following table or 
by DM choice. If a player character race is 
indicated, the character must be created. At 
the DM's option, certain special (expensive) 
incenses can be used that may increase the 
chance for a character to return as a specific 
race or species. A wish spell can restore a 
reincarnated character to its original form 
and status.

If an unusual creature form is indicated, 
the DM can (at his option only) use the 
guidelines for new player character races to 
allow the character to earn experience and 
advance in levels, although this may not be 
in the same class as before. If the reincarnat- 
ed character returns as a creature eligible to 
be the same class as he was previously (i.e., 
a human fighter returns as an elf), the rein- 
carnated character has half his previous 
levels and hit points. If the character returns 
as a new character class, his hit points are 
half his previous total, but he must begin 
again at 1st level. If the character returns as 
a creature unable to have a class, he has half 
the hit points and saving throws of his pre- 
vious incarnation. 


Restoration (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Necromantic 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 3 rounds 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


When this spell is cast, the life energy 
level of the recipient creature is raised by 
one. This reverses any previous life energy 
level drain of the creature by a force or mon- 


ster. Thus, if a 10th-level character had been 
struck by a wight and drained to 9th level, 
the restoration spell would bring the charac- 
ter up to exactly the number of experience 
points necessary to restore him to 10th level 
once again, restoring additional Hit Dice (or 
hit points) and level functions accordingly. 
Restoration is effective only if the spell is 
cast within one day of the recipient's loss of 
life energy, per experience level of the priest 
casting it. A restoration spell restores the 
intelligence of a creature affected by a 
feeblemind spell. It also negates all forms of 
insanity. Casting this spell ages both the 
caster and the recipient by two years. 

The reverse, energy drain, draws away 
one life energy level (see such undead as 
spectre, wight, and vampire, in the Mon- 
strous Compendium). The energy drain 
requires the victim to be touched. Casting 
this form of the spell does not age the caster. 


Resurrection (Necromancy) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Necromantic 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M 

Duration: Permanent 

Casting Time: 1 turn 

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 


The priest employing this spell is able to 
restore life and complete strength to any living 
creature, including elves, he bestows the resur- 
rection spell upon. The creature can have been 
dead up to 10 years per level of the priest cast- 
ing the spell. Thus a 19th-level priest can res- 
urrect the bones of a creature dead up to 190 
years. The creature, upon surviving a resur- 
rection survival check, is immediately 
restored to full hit points and can perform 
strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back 
acreature that has reached its allotted life span 
(i.e., died of natural causes). Casting this spell 
makes it impossible for the priest to cast fur- 
ther spells or engage in combat until he has 
had one day of bed rest for each experience 
level or Hit Die of the creature brought back 
to life. The caster ages three years upon cast- 

The reverse, destruction, causes the vic- 
tim of the spell to be instantly dead and 
turned to dust. A wish spell or equivalent is 
required for recovery. Destruction requires 
a touch, either in combat or otherwise, and 
does not age the caster. In addition, the vic- 
tim is allowed a saving throw (with a —4 
penalty). If the save is successful, the victim 
receives 8d6 points of damage instead. 

The material components of the spell are 
the priest's religious symbol and holy water 
(unholy water for the reverse spell). The 
DM may reduce the chances of successful 
resurrection if little of the creature's remains 
are available.

Succor (Alteration, Enchantment) 
Reversible 


Sphere: Summoning 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 day 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


By casting this spell, the priest creates a 
powerful magic in some specially prepared 
object—a string of prayer beads, a small 
clay tablet, an ivory baton, etc. This object 
radiates magic, for it contains the power to 
instantaneously transport its possessor to 
the sanctuary of the priest who created its 
magic. Once the item is enchanted, the 
priest must give it willingly to an individual, 
at the same time informing him of a com- 
mand word to be spoken when the item is to 
be used, To make use of the item, the recipi- 
ent must speak the command word at the 
same time that he rends or breaks the item. 
When this is done, the individual and all 
that he is wearing and carrying (up to the 
maximum encumbrance limit for the char- 
acter) are instantly transported to the sanc- 
tuary of the priest, just as if the individual 
were capable of speaking a word of recall 
spell. No other creatures can be affected. 

The reversed application of the spell 
causes the priest to be transported to the 
immediate vicinity of the possessor of the 
item when it is broken and the command 
word said. The priest has a general idea of 
the location and situation of the item's pos- 
sessor, and can choose not to be affected by 
this summons. This decision is made at the 
instant when the transportation is to take 
place, but if he chooses not to go, then the 
opportunity is gone forever and the spell is 
wasted. 

The cost of preparing the special item (for 
either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 
to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can 
transport the subject from one plane of 
existence to another, if the DM allows. Note 
that the same factors that can prevent the 
operation of the plane shift and teleport 
spells can also prevent the use of this spell.

for 2d4 rounds. Creatures to whom sunlight 
is harmful or unnatural suffer permanent 
blindness if the saving throw is failed, and 
are blinded for 2d6 rounds if the saving 
throw is successful. Those within its area of 
effect, as well as creatures within 20 feet of 
its perimeter, lose any infravision capabili- 
ties for 1d4 +1 rounds. 

Undead caught within the sunray’s area of 
effect receive 8d6 points of damage, one- 
half if a saving throw vs. spell is successful. 
Those undead 20 feet to either side of the 
sunray’s area of effect receive 3d6 points of 
damage, no damage if a save is successful. 
In addition, the ray may result in the total 
destruction of those undead specifically af- 
fected by sunlight, if their saving throws are 
failed. The ultraviolet light generated by the 
spell inflicts damage on fungoid creatures 
and subterranean fungi just as if they were 
undead, but no saving throw is allowed. 

The material components are an aster 
seed and a piece of aventurine feldspar (sun- 
stone). 


Symbol (Conjuration/Summoning) 


Sphere: Guardian 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 3 

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 


The priest casting this spell inscribes a 
glowing symbol in the air or upon any sur- 
face, according to his desire. Any creature 
looking at the completed symbol within 60 
feet must roll a successful saving throw vs. 
spell or suffer the effect. The symbol glows 
for one turn for each experience level of the 
caster. The particular symbol used is se- 
lected by the caster at the time of casting. 
The caster will not be affected by his own 
symbol. One of the following effects is cho- 
sen by the caster: 


Hopelessness: Creatures seeing it must turn 
back in dejection or surrender to capture 
or attack unless they roll successful sav- 
ing throws vs. spell. Its effects last for 
3d4 turns. 

Pain: Creatures affected suffer —4 penalties 
to their attack rolls and —2 penalties to 
their Dexterity ability scores due to 
wracking pains. The effects last for 2d10 
turns. 

Persuasion: Creatures seeing the symbol be- 
come of the same alignment as and 
friendly to the priest who scribed the 
symbol for 1d20 turns unless a saving 
throw vs. spell is successful. 


The material components of this spell are 
mercury and phosphorus (see 8th-level wiz- 
ard spell, symbol). 


Transmute Metal to Wood (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Earth) 
Range: 80 yards 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 

Area of Effect: 1 metal object 
Saving Throw: Special 


The transmute metal to wood spell en- 
ables the caster to change an object from 
metal to wood. The volume of metal cannot 
exceed a maximum weight of 10 pounds per 
experience level of the priest. Magical ob- 
jects made of metal are 90% resistant to the 
spell, and those on the person of a creature 
receive the creature's saving throw as well. 
Artifacts and relics cannot be transmuted. 
Note that only a wish spell or similar magic 
can restore a transmuted object to its metal- 
lic state. Otherwise, for example, a metal 
door changed to wood would be forever- 
more a wooden door. 


Wind Walk (Alteration) 


Sphere: Elemental (Air) 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 


This spell enables the priest, and possibly 
one or two other persons, to alter the sub- 
stance of his body to a cloud-like vapor. A 
magical wind then wafts the priest along at a 
movement rate of 60, or as slow as 6, as the 
spellcaster wills. The wind walk spell lasts 
as long as the priest desires, up to a maxi- 
mum duration of six turns (one hour) per ex- 
perience level of the caster. For every 8 
levels of experience the priest has attained, 
up to 24, he is able to touch another person 
and carry that person, or those persons, 
along on the wind walk. Persons wind 
walking are not invisible, but rather appear 
misty and translucent. If fully clothed in 
white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken 
for clouds, fog, vapors, etc. The priest can 
regain his physical form as desired, each 
change to and from vaporous form requir- 
ing five rounds. While in vaporous form, 
the priest and companions are hit only by 
magic or magical weaponry, though they 
may be subject to high winds at the DM's 
discretion. No spellcasting is possible in va- 
porous form. 

The material components of this spell are 
fire and holy water.
